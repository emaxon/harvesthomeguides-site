## The Problem with Generic Gardening Advice

Most vegetable gardening books treat the entire United States like one big garden. They give you a single planting date for tomatoes, one set of variety recommendations, and generic advice that works perfectly — if you happen to live in the author's zip code.

For everyone else? It's a recipe for frustration. Late frosts kill early transplants. Heat-intolerant varieties wilt in southern summers. Planting calendars designed for Zone 6 are useless in Zone 9.

## Why Regional Matters

The United States spans USDA hardiness zones 1 through 13. A gardener in Houston faces completely different challenges than one in Minneapolis — different soil types, rainfall patterns, pest pressures, frost dates, and heat levels.

**Harvest Home Guides** exists to solve this. Each book in our series is written for a specific U.S. region, with:

- **Month-by-month planting calendars** tailored to local frost dates and growing seasons
- **Variety recommendations** tested and proven in your specific climate
- **Soil strategies** based on regional soil types (clay, sand, caliche, loam)
- **Pest and disease management** for the bugs and blights you'll actually encounter
- **Water management** appropriate for your rainfall patterns
- **Season extension techniques** that work in your climate
