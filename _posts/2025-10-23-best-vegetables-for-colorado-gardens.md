Colorado gives you 300 days of sunshine and about 90 of them without frost. Choose your vegetables accordingly.

Whether you're gardening on the Front Range at 5,280 feet, in a mountain town at 8,500 feet, or on the Western Slope where things are a bit more forgiving, your vegetable choices need to match your specific slice of Colorado. This isn't a state where one planting list works everywhere. Denver and Leadville are both Colorado, but they might as well be different planets when it comes to growing tomatoes.

Here's what actually works, organized by how much your altitude is working against you.

## Front Range (Denver, Fort Collins, Colorado Springs, Boulder)

**Zone:** 5b–6a | **Elevation:** 5,000–6,500 ft | **Frost-free days:** 140–160

The Front Range is Colorado's sweet spot for vegetable gardening. You have enough frost-free days for warm-season crops, intense sunshine for photosynthesis, and cool nights that keep greens sweet and pest pressure low. Your main challenges are alkaline soil (pH 7.2–8.0 is common), clay that drains poorly, hail, and the occasional late-May blizzard.

### Top Performers

**Tomatoes** — The Front Range grows excellent tomatoes if you choose right.
- **Early Girl** (50 days) — The reliable standard. Sets fruit even in cool springs.
- **Juliet** (60 days) — Grape-sized, crack-resistant, prolific. Best canning tomato for Colorado.
- **Celebrity** (70 days) — Larger fruit, determinate habit. Needs the full season but delivers.
- **Stupice** (60 days) — Czech heirloom that laughs at cold nights. Sets fruit at lower temps than most.
- **Sun Gold** (57 days) — Cherry tomato that produces until hard frost. Addictively sweet.

Plant transplants May 15–25 on the Front Range. Use Wall O' Waters starting May 1 to get a jump.

**Peppers** — Colorado's sunshine makes exceptional peppers.
- **Ace** (50 days) — Early bell pepper. Sets fruit reliably in cool springs.
- **Early Jalapeño** (65 days) — Hotter than regular jalapeño, matures faster.
- **Jimmy Nardello** (75 days) — Sweet Italian frying pepper. Incredible flavor when roasted.
- **Anaheim** (77 days) — Borderline on days but works in warm Front Range seasons. Use black plastic mulch.

**Squash and Cucumbers** — Summer squash is almost too easy. Winter squash is doable with early starts.
- **Black Beauty Zucchini** (50 days) — Plant two. You'll have enough for yourself and every neighbor.
- **Costata Romanesco** (52 days) — Nutty-flavored Italian zucchini. Superior to standard varieties when harvested at 6–8 inches.
- **Marketmore 76 Cucumber** (58 days) — Disease-resistant slicer.
- **Butternut squash** (100 days) — Start indoors, transplant late May. Needs the full season and warm summer to cure.

**Greens** — This is where Colorado shines. Cool nights mean extended lettuce and spinach harvests.
- **Bloomsdale Long Standing Spinach** — Slow to bolt in Colorado's dry air.
- **Red Sails Lettuce** — Heat-tolerant leaf lettuce.
- **Lacinato Kale** — Produces spring through fall. Better after frost.
- **Swiss Chard (Bright Lights)** — Beautiful, productive, and tolerant of everything Colorado throws at it.

**Root Vegetables** — Colorado's loose, well-amended Front Range soil (after you break up the clay) grows excellent roots.
- **Nantes carrots** — Scarlet Nantes or Bolero. Sweet and smooth in Colorado soil.
- **Detroit Dark Red Beets** — Reliable in every Colorado garden.
- **French Breakfast Radishes** — 25 days to harvest. Plant every 2 weeks from April through May, then again August through September.

**Beans** — Bush beans are foolproof on the Front Range. Pole beans need more season but yield more per square foot.
- **Provider** (50 days) — Cold-tolerant bush bean. Can direct sow as early as May 10.
- **Blue Lake Bush** (55 days) — Classic green bean flavor.
- **Rattlesnake Pole Bean** (73 days) — Beautiful speckled pods. Heat-tolerant and vigorous.

### Front Range Tips
- **Amend your soil annually.** Add 2–3 inches of compost every spring. Colorado's alkaline clay needs constant organic matter to stay productive.
- **Add sulfur to lower pH** if you're above 7.5. Blueberries are nearly impossible without serious pH modification, but most vegetables tolerate up to 7.5 fine.
- **Hail protection:** Keep lightweight row cover on hand from May through August. A 5-minute hailstorm can destroy a season's work. Simple wire hoops with Ag-19 fabric save gardens.

## Mountain Communities (Breckenridge, Steamboat, Vail, Telluride, Crested Butte)

**Zone:** 4a–5a | **Elevation:** 7,000–10,000 ft | **Frost-free days:** 60–100

This is expert-mode Colorado gardening. Your season is brutally short, your soil is thin and rocky, frost can appear any month of the year, and deer consider your garden a personal salad bar. But it's absolutely doable — you just need to be ruthless about variety selection.

### What Works Above 7,000 Feet

**Cool-season crops dominate.** At high altitude, lean heavily into these:
- **Peas (Sugar Snap, Oregon Sugar Pod)** — Direct sow as soon as ground thaws, usually late May. Produce until hard frost.
- **Kale (Red Russian, Winterbor)** — The toughest green. Survives light frost and keeps producing.
- **Spinach (Tyee, Space)** — Fast-growing varieties that mature before summer heat arrives. Plant again in August.
- **Lettuce (Winter Density, North Pole)** — Cold-hardy varieties bred for short seasons.
- **Broccoli (Waltham 29, De Cicco)** — Transplant late May to early June. Produces side shoots after main head harvest.
- **Root vegetables** — Carrots (Nantes, Mokum), beets (Early Wonder Tall Top), turnips (Hakurei). All tolerate frost and can be harvested into October under mulch.

**Warm-season crops that earn their spot:**
- **Tomatoes:** Stupice, Glacier, Siberian, 4th of July only. Must use Wall O' Waters or hoop house. Set transplants out in mid-June.
- **Zucchini:** Black Beauty with row cover at night in June and September.
- **Bush beans:** Provider or Contender. Direct sow mid-June. Cut it close but usually works.

**Skip these above 8,000 feet:** Corn, winter squash, melons, eggplant, long-season peppers. Not enough days, not enough heat.

### Mountain Community Tips
- **Raised beds are essential.** They warm faster, drain better, and you fill them with real soil instead of fighting decomposed granite.
- **Hoop houses change everything.** A 10x20-foot hoop house at 8,500 feet effectively adds 4–6 weeks to each end of your season. Tomatoes become reliable instead of a gamble.
- **Deer fencing** needs to be 8 feet tall. Anything shorter is a suggestion, not a barrier.

## Western Slope (Grand Junction, Montrose, Delta, Paonia)

**Zone:** 6a–7a | **Elevation:** 4,500–6,000 ft | **Frost-free days:** 150–180

Colorado's best-kept gardening secret. The Western Slope has warmer temperatures, more frost-free days, and less alkaline soil than the Front Range. The Grand Valley around Grand Junction is orchard country for a reason — the climate supports a much wider range of crops.

### Western Slope Advantages
- **Melons grow here.** Cantaloupe (Hale's Best Jumbo, 86 days) and watermelon (Sugar Baby, 75 days) are viable in the Grand Valley.
- **Long-season peppers thrive.** Poblano, Anaheim, and even some chile varieties have enough days to mature.
- **Winter squash is reliable.** Butternut, acorn, and delicata all mature without season extension.
- **Sweet corn is easy.** Peaches and Cream (72 days), Bodacious (75 days) — plenty of time.

### Western Slope Challenges
- **Water.** The Western Slope is drier than the Front Range. Drip irrigation isn't optional.
- **Late spring frosts.** Paonia and the North Fork Valley sit in a cold-air drainage pattern. Fruit trees get nailed by late frost regularly, and so do early transplants. Don't rush warm-season crops before mid-May.

## Colorado-Wide Recommendations

### Herbs That Thrive Everywhere
- **Basil** — Plant after last frost. Genovese for pesto, Thai for stir-fry. 
- **Cilantro** — Plant early spring and again in fall. Bolts fast in summer heat.
- **Dill** — Direct sow. Self-seeds freely. Great companion for tomatoes.
- **Oregano and Thyme** — Perennial. Colorado's dry climate and intense sun produce exceptionally flavorful plants.
- **Chives** — Perennial, Zone 3 hardy. Thrives everywhere in Colorado.

### Garlic: Plant It This Fall
Colorado grows outstanding garlic. Plant hardneck varieties (Music, German Extra Hardy, Chesnok Red) in October, 6 weeks before the ground freezes. Mulch heavily with straw. Harvest the following July. Hardneck varieties thrive in Colorado's cold winters and produce edible scapes in June as a bonus crop.

## Common Mistakes

1. **Planting warm-season crops too early.** A 70°F day in April doesn't mean frost is done. Wait until mid-May (Front Range) or mid-June (mountains).
2. **Ignoring soil pH.** Most Colorado soil is alkaline. Get a soil test from CSU Extension ($35) before your first season.
3. **Growing what you grew back East.** If you moved from Zone 7 Virginia, your gardening playbook needs a rewrite. Adjust expectations and varieties.
4. **Skipping succession planting.** Plant lettuce and radishes every 2–3 weeks for continuous harvest instead of one big planting that all matures at once.
5. **Underwatering.** Colorado's dry air means plants need more water than the same crops at the same temperature in humid climates. Monitor soil moisture, not just weather.

## Grow What Colorado Grows Best

Colorado's combination of intense sun, cool nights, and dry air produces vegetables with concentrated flavor that humid-climate gardens can't match. Work with your climate — lean into greens, root crops, and short-season varieties — and you'll eat better than you thought possible at a mile high.
