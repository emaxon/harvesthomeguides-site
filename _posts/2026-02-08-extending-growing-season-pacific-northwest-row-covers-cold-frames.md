The Pacific Northwest's biggest gardening limitation isn't cold — it's the combination of short days and wet, cool conditions that slow growth to a crawl from November through February. Season extension here isn't about surviving winter. It's about keeping plants growing through it.

If you live in western Washington, Oregon, or southwestern BC (USDA Zones 8a–8b), your winters rarely kill hardy vegetables outright. Temperatures below 20°F are uncommon in lowland areas. The real enemy is persistent 38°F rain that keeps soil cold, promotes rot, and gives plants just enough misery to stall without actually dying.

Row covers, cold frames, and low tunnels solve this. They raise temperatures by 5–15°F, block rain from direct contact with plants, and — surprisingly — this modest improvement is all it takes to keep many crops actively growing through a PNW winter.

## Understanding What You're Solving For

Before you build anything, understand what season extension does differently in the PNW compared to, say, Minnesota:

**In cold climates:** Season extension prevents freezing. You're fighting temperatures of -10°F to 20°F. You need serious insulation.

**In the PNW:** Season extension keeps rain off plants and raises ambient temperature just enough to sustain growth. You're going from 35–45°F to 45–55°F inside the structure. That's the difference between dormancy and slow, steady growth.

This means your structures can be lighter, cheaper, and simpler than what cold-climate gardeners need. A basic hoop tunnel with greenhouse plastic does more work here than an expensive heated greenhouse does in Vermont.

## Option 1: Floating Row Cover (Easiest)

Floating row cover (also called garden fabric or Reemay) is lightweight spun-bonded polyester that drapes directly over plants. It's the lowest-effort season extension tool and genuinely useful in the PNW.

**What it does:**
- Raises air temperature 2–8°F depending on weight
- Blocks wind (which causes more cold damage than still air at the same temperature)
- Keeps rain from pounding directly on tender greens
- Excludes cabbage moths, flea beetles, and carrot rust fly (a huge secondary benefit)

**Weights and when to use them:**
- **Lightweight (0.5 oz/yd²):** Insect exclusion, 2–4°F of frost protection. Use spring through fall.
- **Medium (1.0 oz/yd²):** 4–6°F protection. Good for fall and early winter.
- **Heavyweight (1.5–2.0 oz/yd²):** 6–8°F protection. Use for the coldest months (December–February). Reduces light transmission to about 50%, which matters when daylight is already scarce.

**How to install:** Drape over plants loosely (leave room for growth), anchor edges with sandbags, rocks, or landscape staples. Don't stretch it tight — the air gap between fabric and plant is where the insulation happens.

**PNW-specific tip:** In the PNW, row cover gets wet and heavy. Use wire hoops (9-gauge wire bent into U-shapes) to hold the fabric above plants even when soaked. This prevents the wet fabric from lying on leaves, which defeats the purpose and promotes rot.

## Option 2: Low Tunnels (Best Value)

Low tunnels — also called caterpillar tunnels or mini hoop houses — are the sweet spot for PNW season extension. They're cheap, effective, and can be built in an afternoon with hardware-store materials.

**Basic construction:**
1. **Hoops:** 10-foot lengths of ½-inch EMT conduit (electrical metallic tubing) or 1-inch PVC, bent into arches over a 3–4 foot wide bed. Space hoops every 4 feet.
2. **Covering:** 6-mil greenhouse poly (not regular plastic sheeting — you need UV-stabilized film). Drape over hoops and secure at the base with sandbags or clamps.
3. **Ends:** Gather and tie, or build simple wooden end frames. Leave one end openable for ventilation.

**Cost:** Under $50 for a 12-foot tunnel over a standard raised bed. The poly lasts 3–4 seasons before UV degradation requires replacement.

**Temperature boost:** 10–15°F on sunny days, 5–8°F on overcast days (which is most days, let's be honest). This is enough to keep lettuce, spinach, chard, and Asian greens growing through December and January.

**The critical detail — ventilation:** PNW low tunnels need ventilation more than cold-climate tunnels need insulation. On a sunny February day, temperatures inside a sealed low tunnel can spike above 80°F, which will cook your lettuce. Prop open one end whenever daytime temperatures exceed 45°F outside. Close it again by late afternoon.

**Moisture management:** Condensation is your biggest enemy inside a PNW tunnel. It drips onto plants and creates the exact fungal conditions you're trying to avoid. Solutions:
- Open ends during dry daylight hours to flush humidity
- Use anti-drip greenhouse poly (has a surfactant coating that makes water sheet rather than drip)
- Space plants widely inside tunnels — crowding amplifies humidity problems

## Option 3: Cold Frames (Most Durable)

A cold frame is essentially a bottomless box with a transparent lid, placed over a garden bed. It's the most effective passive season extension tool and can last decades if well-built.

**Classic design:**
- Back wall: 18 inches high
- Front wall: 12 inches high (this slope faces south to maximize sun angle)
- Lid: Old window sash, polycarbonate panel, or acrylic sheet, hinged at the back
- Size: Whatever fits your bed, but 3x6 feet is a practical maximum for one person to manage

**Materials options:**
- **Budget:** Straw bales for walls + old window on top. Surprisingly effective and costs almost nothing.
- **Moderate:** 2x12 cedar frame with a polycarbonate twin-wall panel lid. Lasts 10+ years.
- **Salvage:** Reclaimed windows from ReStore or similar. Avoid old windows with lead paint unless you seal them thoroughly.

**Temperature performance:** Cold frames provide 10–20°F of frost protection and — crucially — keep rain completely off plants. In the PNW, the rain exclusion is often more valuable than the temperature boost.

**Placement:** Face the sloped lid south. Place against a south-facing wall or fence if possible — reflected and stored heat from the wall adds several degrees of nighttime warmth.

**Management calendar:**
- **October–February:** Keep the lid closed most nights. Prop it open 2–4 inches on any day above 45°F to prevent overheating and reduce condensation.
- **March–April:** Prop open daily, close only on nights below 30°F. Use the cold frame to harden off transplants started indoors.
- **May–September:** Remove the lid entirely or repurpose the frame for drying onions and garlic.

**Pro tip:** A $15 automatic vent opener (sold as "Univent" or "solar vent opener") uses a wax cylinder that expands with heat to automatically prop the lid open above a set temperature. This eliminates the "forgot to vent the cold frame and cooked everything" disaster that every cold frame gardener experiences at least once.

## What to Grow Under Season Extension

Not every crop benefits equally from season extension in the PNW. Focus on crops that grow actively in cool conditions and just need a little help:

**Best performers under cover:**
- Lettuce and salad mixes — actively grow at 40–50°F
- Spinach — cold-tolerant and keeps producing with even minimal warmth
- Mâche (corn salad) — the toughest salad green, grows at near-freezing temperatures
- Claytonia (miner's lettuce) — native to the PNW, thrives in cold frames
- Asian greens — bok choy, tatsoi, and mizuna all grow well under cover
- Radishes — can be sown under cover as early as February

**Marginal performers (worth trying):**
- Carrots — sown in August and covered in October, they sweeten through winter
- Cilantro — actually prefers the cold; grows slowly but steadily under cover
- Green onions — slow but steady all winter

**Not worth it:**
- Warm-season crops under passive season extension don't work in PNW winter. The light levels are too low regardless of temperature. Save tomatoes and peppers for heated greenhouse setups or just wait for June.

## The Perimeter Strategy

The most effective PNW season extension approach combines multiple tools:

1. **Raised beds** provide drainage and slightly warmer soil
2. **Low tunnels or cold frames** over those beds provide rain protection and warmth
3. **Row cover inside tunnels** on the coldest nights adds another layer of protection

This layered approach can keep greens growing through all but the worst PNW cold snaps (those rare nights that dip to 15°F). Three layers of modest protection outperform one layer of heavy protection — and they're cheaper, too.

## Getting Started

If you're new to season extension in the PNW, start with one low tunnel over your best-drained raised bed. Plant it with a salad mix in September. You'll be harvesting fresh greens in December while your neighbors' gardens sit bare, and you'll wonder why you ever let winter stop you from gardening.

The PNW's mild temperatures mean you don't need expensive equipment to garden [year-round gardening](/blog/year-round-vegetable-gardening-pacific-northwest). You just need to keep the rain off and add a few degrees. Everything else, this climate provides for free.
