You moved to the Mountain West for the views. Nobody warned you about the June snow. Or the frost that shows up in August like an uninvited guest. Or the 40-degree temperature swings that make your tomatoes question their life choices.

Planting vegetables in Colorado, Utah, Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming isn't like gardening anywhere else. Your growing season might be 90 days or 160 days depending on whether you live at 3,500 feet in Boise or 9,000 feet outside Leadville. Generic planting calendars from seed packets? Those were written for Ohio. You need dates that account for altitude, late snowpack, and the kind of UV exposure that turns lettuce bitter by July.

Here's your real planting timeline, broken down by zone and elevation.

## Know Your Zone (And Your Microclimate)

The Mountain West spans USDA Zones 3 through 6, sometimes Zone 7 in protected valleys of southern Utah. But zone numbers only tell half the story. Two gardens in Zone 5 can have wildly different planting windows if one sits at 4,200 feet in Logan, Utah, and the other at 7,200 feet in Steamboat Springs, Colorado.

**What matters more than zone:**
- Your last spring frost date (check with your county extension office — not Google's first result)
- Your first fall frost date
- Total frost-free days between them
- Whether you're on a north-facing slope (colder) or south-facing slope (warmer)
- Wind exposure — a hilltop garden in Wyoming might as well be a zone colder

**Pro Tip:** Keep a garden journal your first year. Record the actual last frost, first frost, and any mid-summer temperature dips. Your microclimate data beats any chart.

## Cool-Season Crops: The Mountain West's Strong Suit

This is where your climate actually helps. Cool nights and moderate summer days mean lettuce, spinach, peas, and brassicas thrive here longer than in the sweltering Midwest or South.

### Direct Sow Outdoors (Spring)

| Crop | Zone 3-4 (MT, WY, high CO) | Zone 5 (most CO, UT, ID) | Zone 6 (low valleys) |
|------|---------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------|
| Peas | May 1–15 | April 15–30 | April 1–15 |
| Spinach | May 1–15 | April 10–25 | March 25–April 10 |
| Lettuce | May 1–20 | April 15–May 1 | April 1–15 |
| Radishes | May 1–15 | April 15–30 | April 1–15 |
| Carrots | May 10–25 | April 20–May 10 | April 5–20 |
| Beets | May 10–25 | April 20–May 10 | April 10–25 |
| Kale | May 1–15 | April 10–25 | March 25–April 10 |

These crops tolerate light frost (28–32°F), so you can push them out a week or two before your last frost date. Soil temperature matters more than air temperature — wait until the ground hits 40°F for most of these, 50°F for beans.

### Fall Planting (The Secret Season)

Mountain West gardeners who skip fall planting are leaving their best harvests on the table. Cool-season crops planted in late July through mid-August produce better quality than spring plantings because they mature in cooling temperatures instead of rising ones.

- **Zone 5 fall sowing window:** July 20–August 15 for lettuce, spinach, radishes, and kale
- **Zone 3-4:** Start by July 10–25 to beat early September frosts
- **Zone 6:** You have until August 20–September 1 for quick crops like radishes and arugula

## Warm-Season Crops: Where Timing Gets Critical

Tomatoes, peppers, squash, beans, and corn need warm soil and frost-free nights. This is where Mountain West gardening gets tricky.

### Transplant Outdoors

| Crop | Zone 3-4 | Zone 5 | Zone 6 |
|------|----------|--------|--------|
| Tomatoes | June 1–15 | May 20–June 5 | May 10–20 |
| Peppers | June 5–15 | May 25–June 10 | May 15–25 |
| Squash/Zucchini | June 1–10 | May 20–June 1 | May 10–20 |
| Cucumbers | June 5–15 | May 25–June 5 | May 15–25 |

### Direct Sow Warm-Season

| Crop | Zone 3-4 | Zone 5 | Zone 6 |
|------|----------|--------|--------|
| Bush Beans | June 1–15 | May 20–June 5 | May 10–25 |
| Corn | June 1–10 | May 20–June 1 | May 5–20 |
| Summer Squash | June 1–15 | May 20–June 5 | May 10–20 |

**Pro Tip:** Soil temperature is non-negotiable for warm-season crops. Stick a meat thermometer 4 inches into your garden bed at 8 AM. Beans need 60°F minimum. Corn wants 65°F. Tomatoes and peppers prefer 65–70°F. If the soil isn't there yet, waiting a week beats replanting after your seeds rot.

## Starting Seeds Indoors: Your Season Extender

With 90–120 frost-free days in most Mountain West locations, starting seeds indoors isn't optional for tomatoes, peppers, and eggplant. It's survival.

**Indoor start timeline (count backward from your transplant date):**
- **Peppers and eggplant:** 8–10 weeks before transplant
- **Tomatoes:** 6–8 weeks before transplant
- **Broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage:** 6–8 weeks before transplant
- **Squash and cucumbers:** 3–4 weeks before transplant (don't start these too early — they hate transplanting once rootbound)

For a Zone 5 gardener transplanting tomatoes around May 25, that means starting seeds indoors around March 25–April 10. Peppers go in the seed trays by mid-March.

## State-by-State Adjustments

### Colorado
The Front Range (Denver, Fort Collins, Colorado Springs) sits in Zone 5b-6a around 5,000–6,500 feet. Last frost: May 5–15. Mountain communities above 8,000 feet may not see their last frost until mid-June. Pueblo and Grand Junction in Zone 6b-7a get earlier starts — sometimes April transplanting for cool-season crops.

### Utah
Salt Lake Valley is Zone 6b with a last frost around April 15–May 1. The Wasatch Back (Park City, Heber) is Zone 5a-5b, last frost May 15–June 1. Southern Utah (St. George) is a different world entirely — Zone 8a with February planting windows.

### Idaho
Boise sits in Zone 6b-7a with a surprisingly long season (150+ frost-free days). But most of Idaho — the Snake River Plain, the panhandle — runs Zone 4-5 with last frosts in late May. Moscow and Sandpoint gardeners don't rush anything before Memorial Day.

### Montana
Most of Montana is Zone 3-5. Billings (Zone 5a) gets a last frost around May 10–20. Helena and Great Falls (Zone 4b-5a) see late May frosts. The mountain valleys — Missoula, Butte, Bozeman — deal with cold air drainage that makes frost dates unpredictable. A frost on June 15 isn't unusual at 5,000+ feet.

### Wyoming
Wyoming gardening is an exercise in stubbornness and wind management. Cheyenne (Zone 5b) has a last frost around May 15–25, but wind chill effectively shortens the season. Sheridan and Cody sit in Zone 4-5. Anything above 7,000 feet might see 70 frost-free days in a good year.

## Season Extension: Not Optional Here

If you want tomatoes, peppers, or melons in the Mountain West, you need at least one of these:

- **Wall O' Waters or similar season extenders:** Set them out 2–4 weeks before your last frost date around transplants. They create a warm microclimate that can buy you 3–4 weeks.
- **Row covers (floating):** Ag-19 or Ag-30 weight for frost protection (2–8°F of buffer)
- **Cold frames:** Essential for spring starts and fall extension
- **Hoop houses or high tunnels:** The gold standard. Extend your season 4–8 weeks on each end.

**Pro Tip:** In Zone 4 and colder, a simple hoop house over a raised bed can move your effective zone up by a full number. A Zone 4 garden with a hoop house gardens like Zone 5.

## Common Mistakes

1. **Planting by calendar date instead of soil temperature.** May 15 means nothing if the ground is still 45°F from snowmelt.
2. **Ignoring wind.** A windy site dries soil faster and cools plants. Use windbreaks or move your garden.
3. **Starting seeds indoors too late.** If you wait until April to start tomato seeds for a June 1 transplant, you're only giving them 8 weeks. Start earlier.
4. **Skipping fall gardening.** Your fall season is often more productive than spring. Use it.
5. **Treating the Mountain West like one climate.** Boise and Bozeman are both "Mountain West" but they garden in completely different realities.

## Your Next Step

Getting the timing right is the single biggest factor in Mountain West vegetable gardening success. But timing is just the start — you also need to choose the right varieties, build soil that works at altitude, and manage water in a semi-arid climate.

If you're ready to go deeper, grab a copy of *The Mountain West Vegetable Gardening Guide* from Harvest Home Guides. It covers variety selection, soil building, irrigation, pest management, and month-by-month task lists for every zone in the region. Written specifically for gardeners in Colorado, Utah, Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming — because you deserve better than advice written for sea level.
