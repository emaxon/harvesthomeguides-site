February in Southern California is one of those months that makes gardeners everywhere else jealous. While much of the country is still buried under snow or staring at frozen ground, you're standing in sunshine with soil that's ready to work. This is your bridge month — the sweet spot where cool-season crops are still going strong and warm-season planting is just getting started.

If you play February right, you'll set yourself up for a spring and summer garden that produces nonstop. Here's exactly what to do.

## Why February Matters in SoCal Gardens

Southern California spans USDA zones 9b through 11a, and February sits right in the transition window. Nighttime lows in most inland valleys hover between 40°F and 50°F, while coastal areas rarely dip below 45°F. Daytime highs reach the mid-60s to low 70s.

That means your cool-season crops — lettuce, peas, brassicas — are in their prime. But it also means soil temperatures are climbing toward the 60°F mark, which is the magic number for starting warm-season crops like tomatoes and peppers.

The key to February success is working both sides of that transition simultaneously.

## Cool-Season Crops to Plant Now

These vegetables thrive in February's mild temperatures and will produce well into April before the heat arrives.

### Leafy Greens

Direct sow lettuce, spinach, arugula, and Swiss chard right now. Succession plant every two weeks through March to keep a continuous harvest going. Butterhead and romaine varieties do especially well in SoCal's mild winters — try 'Jericho' romaine, which was bred for warm climates and handles the inevitable early heat wave better than most.

Kale and collard greens planted now will give you months of harvests. 'Lacinato' (dinosaur) kale is particularly well-suited to Southern California gardens because it tolerates both the cool nights and the warming days without bolting quickly.

### Peas

February is your last good window for peas in most of Southern California. Sugar snap and snow peas planted now will climb and produce before temperatures consistently hit the 80s. Get them in the ground in the first two weeks of the month if you can. They need about 60 days to mature, and you want them harvesting before late April's heat shuts them down.

### Root Vegetables

Carrots, beets, radishes, and turnips all go directly in the ground now. Carrots take patience — 70 to 80 days for most varieties — but February planting means you'll be pulling them in April and May when they're at their sweetest.

For beets, try 'Chioggia' or 'Detroit Dark Red.' Both handle SoCal conditions beautifully and mature in 55 to 60 days.

### Brassicas

If you didn't get broccoli, cauliflower, or cabbage transplants in the ground in January, early February is your last realistic chance. These crops need 60 to 90 days of cool weather to head up properly. Transplants are the way to go this late — starting from seed will push your harvest into the heat, and you'll end up with bitter, bolted plants instead of tight heads.

## Warm-Season Crops to Start Indoors

Here's where February gets exciting. You're not planting these outside yet, but starting them indoors now puts you weeks ahead of gardeners who wait until March or April.

### Tomatoes

Start tomato seeds indoors in early to mid-February. They need 6 to 8 weeks before transplanting outdoors, which puts you right at late March to mid-April — perfect timing for most of Southern California. Choose varieties bred for warm climates: 'Early Girl,' 'Celebrity,' and 'Sun Gold' are reliable producers. For heirloom lovers, 'Cherokee Purple' and 'Brandywine' both do well if you give them afternoon shade once summer heat arrives.

Keep seedlings under grow lights or in a bright south-facing window. Soil temperature for germination should be 70°F to 80°F — a seedling heat mat makes a big difference.

### Peppers

Peppers are slower than tomatoes, so start them now too. They need 8 to 10 weeks indoors before transplant. Bell peppers, jalapeños, and Anaheims are all excellent choices for SoCal gardens. If you're into hot peppers, habaneros and Thai chilis absolutely love Southern California's long, warm growing season.

### Squash and Cucumbers

These grow fast, so hold off on starting seeds until late February or early March. They only need 3 to 4 weeks indoors before transplanting. Starting too early means leggy, root-bound seedlings that struggle after transplant.

## Direct Sow Warm-Season Crops in Late February

If you're in a warmer microclimate — think inland valleys like the San Fernando Valley, Riverside, or San Diego's inland areas — you can direct sow some warm-season crops in the last week of February, provided your soil temperature has reached 60°F.

Beans are the best candidate for late February direct sowing. Bush beans germinate quickly in warm soil and don't mind the occasional cool night. 'Provider' and 'Contender' are both cold-tolerant varieties that handle the transition well.

Corn can go in at the end of the month in the warmest areas, but most gardeners are better off waiting until mid-March when soil is consistently above 65°F.

## Soil Preparation Tips for February

February is an ideal time to get your beds ready for the coming warm season, even if you're not planting warm crops yet.

**Amend your soil now.** Work 2 to 3 inches of compost into beds that will hold your spring and summer crops. SoCal soils are often alkaline and low in organic matter, so consistent compost additions make a dramatic difference over time. If you're dealing with heavy clay (common in many inland areas), add both compost and coarse perlite to improve drainage.

**Test your soil pH.** Most vegetables prefer a pH between 6.0 and 7.0. Southern California soils frequently test above 7.5. If your pH is high, sulfur amendments worked in now will have time to lower it before your warm-season transplants go in.

**Mulch wisely.** For cool-season crops currently in the ground, maintain a light mulch layer to retain moisture. For beds you're preparing for warm-season crops, leave mulch off until after transplanting — you want the soil to absorb as much warmth as possible in the weeks ahead.

## Watering in February

February is typically one of Southern California's wetter months, but "wet" is relative in a region that averages 15 inches of rain per year. Don't assume winter rains are enough.

Check soil moisture regularly. Stick your finger 2 inches into the soil — if it's dry, water. Cool-season crops need about 1 inch of water per week. Seedlings started indoors need consistent moisture but not soggy soil — bottom watering trays work well to prevent damping off.

If you're on a drip irrigation system, keep it running on a reduced schedule. Many SoCal gardeners shut their systems off entirely during winter, which stresses established crops more than they realize.

## Pest Watch

February's mild weather brings out a few pests to watch for:

- **Aphids** love cool-season brassicas and peas. Check the undersides of leaves regularly. A strong blast of water from the hose handles mild infestations. For persistent colonies, insecticidal soap works well.
- **Snails and slugs** are most active after rain. Hand-pick them in the evening or use iron phosphate bait around vulnerable seedlings.
- **Cabbage white butterflies** are already flying in many areas. If you see them, it's time to put floating row covers over your brassicas before they lay eggs.

## Your February Action Plan

Here's the condensed version of what to do this month:

**Week 1-2:**
- Direct sow lettuce, spinach, peas, carrots, beets, radishes
- Start tomato and pepper seeds indoors
- Transplant broccoli and cauliflower if you haven't already
- Amend and prepare warm-season beds

**Week 3-4:**
- Continue succession planting leafy greens
- Start squash and cucumber seeds indoors
- Direct sow beans in warm microclimates
- Monitor for aphids and cabbage whites
- Check irrigation systems before spring ramp-up
