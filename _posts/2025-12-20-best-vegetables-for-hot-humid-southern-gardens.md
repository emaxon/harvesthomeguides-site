Your neighbor's garden looks like a salad bar in May and a crime scene by August. That's not bad luck — it's bad variety selection. Most seed catalogs are written for people who garden in 75°F weather with moderate humidity. That's maybe six weeks of your year.

Southeast gardening means choosing varieties that were bred for — or at least tolerate — 95°F afternoons, 80% humidity, and the fungal diseases that come with that combination. Here's what actually works.

## The Heat-Humidity Double Punch

Heat alone is manageable. Humidity alone is manageable. Together, they create conditions where:

- **Fungal diseases** explode (powdery mildew, downy mildew, early blight, late blight, anthracnose)
- **Pollination fails** when nighttime temps stay above 75°F ([tomatoes](/blog/growing-tomatoes-in-the-south-beat-the-heat) and peppers are especially sensitive)
- **Soil stays wet** longer, leading to root rot in poorly drained beds

Your variety choices need to account for all three. A tomato that handles Arizona heat will rot on the vine in Alabama humidity. Different game entirely.

## Tomatoes: The Southern Obsession

Let's start here because everyone grows tomatoes and everyone in the South has strong opinions about them.

**Best heat-tolerant varieties:**

- **Solar Fire** — Developed by the University of Florida specifically for hot conditions. Sets fruit when other varieties quit. Determinate, 72 days. This is your reliability pick.
- **Heat Wave II** — Sets fruit at temperatures that make Celebrity drop every blossom. Determinate, 68 days.
- **Phoenix** — Another UF release. Disease-resistant and heat-tolerant. Semi-determinate.
- **Arkansas Traveler** — Heirloom that actually handles heat. Indeterminate, pink fruit, 85 days. Lower yields than hybrids but the flavor is worth it.
- **Cherokee Purple** — Yes, this heirloom works in the South (it's from Tennessee). Needs good airflow and early planting. Indeterminate, 80 days.
- **Tropic** — Bred for tropical conditions. Indeterminate, disease-resistant, large fruit.

**Pro Tip:** In zones 8a+, plant tomatoes in early March and aim for harvest before late June. Then plant a second round of heat-tolerant determinates in late July for [fall gardening](/blog/fall-vegetable-gardening-in-the-southeast) harvest. Trying to keep [spring planting guide](/blog/southeast-spring-vegetable-garden-planting-guide) tomatoes alive through August in coastal Georgia is an exercise in suffering.

## Peppers: They Actually Like It Here

Good news — peppers are more heat-tolerant than tomatoes. Most varieties do well, but these are standouts:

- **Cajun Belle** — AAS winner, compact plants, sweet mini bells. Prolific in heat.
- **Carmen** — Italian roasting pepper. Handles humidity well, disease-resistant.
- **Anaheim** — Mild heat, thick walls, produces all summer.
- **Fish Pepper** — Heirloom from the Chesapeake Bay area. Variegated leaves, medium heat, beautiful plants.
- **Jalapeño (TAM Mild)** — Texas A&M release, slightly milder, heavy producer.
- **Habanero** — These *want* heat. Zone 8+ gardeners, this is your crop.

Peppers do slow down when temps exceed 95°F, but they recover when it cools. Don't rip them out in August — they'll give you a massive fall flush in September and October.

## Okra: The Heat Champion

If you're not growing okra in the Southeast, you're ignoring the most perfectly adapted crop for your climate. Okra *thrives* at 90°F+. It's from West Africa. It was built for this.

- **Clemson Spineless** — The classic. Heavy yields, 56 days, no spines on the pods.
- **Burgundy** — Red pods, ornamental and edible. Slightly lower yield.
- **Jambalaya** — Compact plants (3–4 feet), good for smaller gardens.
- **Hill Country Heirloom Red** — Stunning red pods, open-pollinated, great flavor.

Harvest every 2 days when it's hot. Pods go from perfect to woody in 48 hours during peak summer. Cut at 3–4 inches.

## Southern Peas (Cowpeas): Unsung Heroes

These are nitrogen-fixing, heat-loving, drought-tolerant machines. If you've never grown Southern peas, you're about to become a convert.

- **Mississippi Silver** — Crowder type, excellent fresh or dried. 64 days.
- **Pinkeye Purple Hull** — The most popular variety in the South for good reason. 60 days.
- **California Blackeye #5** — Blackeye type, disease-resistant, reliable.
- **Zipper Cream** — Easy to shell (they literally unzip), buttery flavor. 75 days.
- **Red Ripper** — Also works as a cover crop. Extremely heat and drought tolerant.

Plant after soil hits 65°F. They need zero fertilizer — in fact, too much nitrogen hurts production. Just plant, water occasionally, and harvest.

## Sweet Potatoes: The Southeast Staple

Forget Irish potatoes in summer — they're a cool-season crop that's done by June. Sweet potatoes are your warm-season root crop, and they love exactly the conditions you have.

- **Beauregard** — The standard. Orange flesh, 90 days, developed at LSU.
- **Covington** — Developed at NC State. Slightly better disease resistance than Beauregard. Excellent flavor.
- **Georgia Jet** — Early maturing (90 days), good for zones 7a–7b where the season is shorter.
- **Vardaman** — Compact vines, good for raised beds. Bush-type.
- **White Yam (O'Henry)** — White flesh, drier texture, some people prefer it for savory dishes.

Plant slips after soil reaches 65°F (late April in zone 8, late May in zone 7a). They need 90–120 days of warm weather. Don't rush it.

## Heat-Tolerant Greens (Yes, They Exist)

You don't have to give up greens in summer. These handle the heat:

- **Malabar Spinach** — Not true spinach, but the thick, glossy leaves are excellent in stir-fries. Vining plant, loves heat and humidity. Zones 8+, this grows like a weed.
- **New Zealand Spinach** — Another heat-tolerant spinach substitute. Sprawling habit, cut-and-come-again.
- **Swiss Chard (Bright Lights)** — More heat-tolerant than most greens. Harvest outer leaves continuously.
- **Sweet Potato Greens** — The leaves of your sweet potato plants are edible and nutritious. Two crops in one.
- **Collards (Georgia Southern, Vates)** — Surprisingly heat-tolerant. They'll look rough in August but bounce back in September with the best flavor of the year.
- **Amaranth** — Grown as a green across the tropics. Callaloo varieties are heat-loving and nutritious.

## Summer Squash and Cucumbers

These produce heavily but have a limited window before vine borers and beetles take them down.

**Squash:**
- **Dunja** (zucchini) — Powdery mildew resistant. This matters enormously in the humid South.
- **Yellow Crookneck** — Southern classic. More disease-resistant than straightneck types.
- **Tromboncino** — Italian heirloom, technically a winter squash harvested young. **Vine borer resistant** because it's *Cucurbita moschata*, not *C. pepo*. This is the cheat code for Southern squash growing.
- **Tatume** — Mexican heirloom, *C. moschata*, vine borer resistant, heavy producer.

**Cucumbers:**
- **Marketmore 76** — Disease-resistant standard.
- **Poinsett 76** — Developed at Clemson specifically for the Southeast. Downy and powdery mildew resistant.
- **Diva** — Gynoecious (mostly female flowers), parthenocarpic (no pollination needed), disease-resistant. Heavy producer.

**Pro Tip:** Succession plant squash and cucumbers every 3–4 weeks from your last frost through mid-July. When vine borers kill your first planting, the second one is already producing.

## Beans

**Bush beans** that handle heat:
- **Contender** — The Southeast standard. 50 days, tolerates heat better than most.
- **Provider** — Early, disease-resistant, sets pods in cool *and* hot weather.
- **Roma II** — Flat Italian type, good disease resistance.

**Pole beans:**
- **Rattlesnake** — Heirloom, beautiful purple-streaked pods, heat-tolerant, prolific.
- **Kentucky Wonder** — Classic for a reason. 65 days, handles heat.

**Yard-long beans (Asparagus beans):**
These are actually cowpeas, not green beans. They *love* heat and produce all summer when regular beans quit. Grow them on a trellis and harvest at 12–18 inches.

## Watermelon and Cantaloupe

The Southeast is watermelon country. You have the heat, the season length, and the sandy soils (in many areas) that melons love.

- **Charleston Gray** — Developed in South Carolina. 85 days, disease-resistant.
- **Crimson Sweet** — The standard. 80 days, reliable.
- **Sugar Baby** — Icebox type, 75 days, good for smaller gardens.
- **Ambrosia** cantaloupe — Disease-resistant, bred for the Southeast.
- **Athena** cantaloupe — Commercial standard in the South. Fusarium resistant.

## Herbs That Handle the Heat

- **Basil** (any variety) — Loves heat. Watch for downy mildew; Devotion and Amazel are resistant.
- **Rosemary** — Mediterranean herb that thrives in Southern heat if drainage is good.
- **Lemongrass** — Perennial in zones 8b+. Grows into a massive clump.
- **Thai Basil** — More heat-tolerant and bolt-resistant than sweet basil.
- **Mexican Oregano** — Different species than Mediterranean oregano, much more heat-tolerant.

## Common Mistakes

**Growing Northern varieties.** Brandywine tomatoes in zone 8b Alabama will disappoint you. They need cool nights that you don't have. Choose Southern-adapted varieties.

**Fighting summer instead of working with it.** Grow what wants to grow in July (okra, Southern peas, sweet potatoes) instead of forcing lettuce under shade cloth and prayer.

**Ignoring disease resistance.** In 80% humidity, disease resistance isn't a nice-to-have — it's the difference between harvesting and composting. Always check the disease resistance codes on seed packets.

**Overwatering.** Humid conditions mean the soil stays moist longer. Soggy roots plus heat equals dead plants. Mulch heavily, water deeply but less frequently.
