## Why Raised Beds?

Raised beds solve most of the problems that frustrate beginner vegetable gardeners:

1. **Bad soil doesn't matter.** Clay, sand, rocks, caliche — whatever's underneath, you control what goes in the raised bed.
2. **Better drainage.** Raised soil drains faster than in-ground beds, which most vegetables prefer.
3. **Soil warms faster in spring.** Get a 2–3 week head start on the growing season.
4. **Less bending and kneeling.** Beds 18–24 inches tall are much easier on your back.
5. **Clear boundaries.** You know exactly where your garden is, where to walk, and where to plant.
6. **Less compaction.** You never walk on raised bed soil, so it stays loose and aerated.
7. **Fewer weeds.** Imported soil has fewer weed seeds, and the defined borders make mulching easier.

## Choosing the Right Size

### Length and Width

- **Width: 3–4 feet maximum.** You need to reach the center from either side without stepping in the bed. 4 feet is standard, but 3 feet works better for kids and shorter gardeners.
- **Length: 6–8 feet is most popular.** Longer beds work fine but require more lumber and soil. Stay under 12 feet to prevent bowing.
- **A 4×8-foot bed** is the most popular size and produces a surprising amount of food.

### Height

- **6 inches:** Minimum useful height. Works for lettuce, herbs, and shallow-rooted crops. Cheapest option.
- **12 inches:** Ideal for most vegetables. Deep enough for tomatoes, peppers, carrots, and most root crops.
- **18–24 inches:** Best for accessibility, areas with very poor native soil, or growing deep-rooted crops. More soil = more cost.
- **24–36 inches:** Table height. Excellent for wheelchair accessibility or anyone who can't bend at all.

### How Many Beds?

Start with **one or two 4×8-foot beds.** That's 32–64 square feet of growing space — enough to learn the basics and produce meaningful amounts of food. Expand once you've had a successful season.

## Materials: What to Build With

### Wood (Most Popular)

- **Cedar:** Naturally rot-resistant, lasts 10–15 years. Most popular choice. More expensive.
- **Redwood:** Similar to cedar in rot resistance and longevity. Limited availability outside the West Coast.
- **Douglas Fir/Pine:** Cheaper but rots faster (3–5 years). Budget-friendly option. Replace when they deteriorate.
- **Do NOT use:** Pressure-treated lumber made before 2004 (CCA — contains arsenic). Modern pressure-treated wood (ACQ/CA) is considered safe by most extension services, but many organic gardeners avoid it.

### Other Materials

- **Galvanized steel/stock tanks:** Trendy, durable, last forever. Can get hot in southern climates — insulate the inside with straw bales the first season.
- **Concrete blocks:** Cheap, permanent, functional. Not the most attractive but very effective.
- **Stone/brick:** Beautiful but expensive and labor-intensive to build.
- **Composite lumber:** Rot-proof, lasts indefinitely. Expensive.

### What About No-Build Options?

You don't need to build anything. Options:
- **Mounded beds:** Just mound soil 6–8 inches high in 4-foot-wide rows
- **Straw bale gardens:** Plant directly into conditioned straw bales
- **Grow bags:** Fabric containers that function like individual raised beds

## Filling Your Raised Beds

This is the most important — and most expensive — part of raised bed gardening. Don't skimp on soil quality.

### The Ideal Mix

For a 12-inch-deep raised bed:

**60% quality topsoil + 30% compost + 10% drainage amendment (perlite, vermiculite, or expanded shale)**

This gives you:
- Structure and mineral content (topsoil)
- Nutrients and biological activity (compost)
- Drainage and aeration (perlite/shale)

### Budget Options

Quality raised bed mix is expensive. For a 4×8×1-foot bed, you need about 32 cubic feet of material.

**Cost-saving strategies:**
- **Buy in bulk** from a landscape supply company, not bags from big-box stores. Delivered bulk soil costs a fraction of bagged.
- **Hügelkultur base:** Fill the bottom third with logs, branches, and leaves. Top with soil mix. Reduces the volume of purchased soil by 30% and improves long-term fertility as the wood decomposes.
- **Lasagna method:** Layer cardboard, leaves, grass clippings, and compost in the bottom half. Top with 6 inches of quality soil mix.

### What NOT to Use

- **Pure compost:** Shrinks dramatically as it decomposes, drains poorly when saturated, and can be too nutrient-rich
- **Garden soil from bags:** Often too heavy and poorly draining
- **Fill dirt:** No nutrients, may contain debris or contaminants
- **Sand alone:** Drains too fast, no nutrients

## Bed Placement

### Sunlight

Orient beds **north to south** for even sun exposure on all plants. Place beds where they get **at least 6–8 hours of direct sunlight.** In hot climates (Zone 8+), afternoon shade is a bonus.

### Access

Leave **2–3 feet between beds** for walking, wheelbarrow access, and kneeling. Paths can be mulched (wood chips or straw) to suppress weeds.

### Water Access

Place beds within hose reach. Consider running a central water line with drip irrigation branches to each bed.

### Level Ground

Beds should be on level ground. On slopes, use the downhill side as the tall side and level across.

## What to Plant in Raised Beds

### Space-Efficient Crops (Best Return per Square Foot)

1. **Lettuce/salad greens** — grows fast, can be succession planted, cut-and-come-again varieties produce for weeks
2. **Tomatoes** — need vertical space (cages/stakes) but produce pounds of fruit per plant
3. **Peppers** — compact plants, long production season
4. **Bush beans** — quick crop, high yield, plant every 3 weeks for continuous harvest
5. **Kale** — single plant produces for months of harvesting
6. **Herbs** — basil, parsley, cilantro, chives produce abundantly in small spaces
7. **Carrots** — perfect for raised beds where you control soil depth and texture
8. **Radishes** — fastest crop: 25 days seed to harvest

### Crops That Need More Space

These work in raised beds but take up a lot of room per plant:

- **Squash/Zucchini** — 1 plant per 4 square feet minimum. Trellis if possible.
- **Corn** — needs at least a 4×4 block for pollination
- **Watermelon** — sprawling vines, though they can trail over the edge
- **Potatoes** — productive but take up bed space for 3–4 months

### A First-Year Raised Bed Plan (4×8 Bed)

**Spring planting:**

```
[  Tomato  ] [  Tomato  ] [ Pepper ] [ Pepper ]
[  Bush Beans (1 row)  ] [ Herbs: basil, cilantro ]
[ Lettuce mix ] [ Carrots ] [ Radishes ]
```

**Fall planting (same bed):**

```
[ Kale ] [ Kale ] [ Broccoli ] [ Broccoli ]
[ Lettuce (succession) ] [ Spinach ]
[ Carrots ] [ Beets ] [ Radishes ]
```

## Watering Raised Beds

Raised beds dry out faster than in-ground gardens because they're exposed on all sides. This is the #1 maintenance task.

### Drip Irrigation (Highly Recommended)

A soaker hose or drip line running through the bed is the most efficient watering method:
- Uses less water than overhead watering
- Keeps foliage dry (reducing disease)
- Delivers water consistently to the root zone
- Can be put on a timer for automated watering

### Hand Watering

If hand watering, use a gentle wand attachment. Water at the base of plants, not overhead. Check moisture daily during summer.

### How Much Water

- **General rule:** 1 inch of water per week
- **Hot climates or summer:** May need 2 inches per week or more
- **Check soil moisture:** Stick your finger 2 inches deep. If dry, water.
- **New seedlings:** Keep consistently moist (not soggy) until established

### Mulch Is Mandatory

Apply 2–3 inches of organic mulch (straw, shredded leaves, wood chips) on the soil surface. This:
- Reduces watering needs by 30–50%
- Keeps soil temperature stable
- Suppresses weeds
- Breaks down to feed the soil

## Fertilizing Raised Beds

Raised bed soil needs regular feeding because:
- Plants extract nutrients rapidly in the concentrated growing space
- Water flowing through carries nutrients away
- Organic matter decomposes and settles, reducing volume over time

### Feeding Schedule

1. **Before each season:** Add 1–2 inches of compost to the top of the bed and work in lightly
2. **At planting:** Use a slow-release organic fertilizer (follow package rates)
3. **Monthly during growing season:** Side-dress heavy feeders (tomatoes, peppers, squash) with compost or organic fertilizer
4. **End of season:** Add compost or cover with shredded leaves as mulch for winter

### Top Up Annually

Raised bed soil settles and decomposes over time. Each year, add 2–3 inches of compost to maintain the soil level and replenish organic matter.

## Pest Management in Raised Beds

Raised beds have some built-in pest advantages:
- Higher off the ground, so some crawling pests have farther to travel
- Clean imported soil has fewer pest larvae
- Easy to install protective structures

### Physical Protection

- **Floating row covers:** Drape over hoops to block flying insects (cabbage moths, flea beetles, squash vine borers)
- **Hardware cloth on the bottom:** Before filling, lay 1/2-inch hardware cloth on the ground to prevent gophers and voles from tunneling up
- **Copper tape around the top edge:** Deters slugs and snails

### Organic Pest Control

- **Hand-pick** large pests (caterpillars, beetles)
- **Bt spray** for caterpillars (cabbage worms, tomato hornworms)
- **Neem oil** for aphids, whiteflies, and other soft-bodied insects
- **Companion planting:** Marigolds, basil, and nasturtiums near vegetables deter some pests

## Common Raised Bed Mistakes

1. **Building too wide.** If you can't reach the center without stepping in, the bed is too wide. Max 4 feet.

2. **Cheap soil.** Bad soil in a raised bed is still bad soil. Invest in quality mix.

3. **No mulch.** Raised beds dry out fast. Mulch is not optional.

4. **Overplanting.** Crowded plants compete for water, light, and nutrients. Follow spacing recommendations.

5. **Ignoring crop rotation.** Even in raised beds, don't plant the same family in the same spot every year. Rotate tomatoes, peppers (nightshade family), brassicas, and root crops.

6. **No soil replenishment.** Soil quality declines each year without amendment. Add compost every season.

7. **Bottom barriers.** Don't put landscape fabric on the bottom of raised beds — it prevents roots from growing into native soil and reduces drainage. Use hardware cloth only if you have burrowing pests.

## Raised Beds in Different Climates

### Hot Climates (Zones 8–10)

- Metal beds can overheat roots — insulate interior walls with cardboard or straw
- Mulch heavily to keep soil cool
- Consider shade cloth frames during peak summer
- Water more frequently — daily in extreme heat

If you're in the South, our [beginner guide to southern vegetable gardening](/blog/how-to-start-a-vegetable-garden-in-the-south/) has more regional tips.

### Cold Climates (Zones 4–6)

- Raised beds warm up faster in spring — major advantage
- Can freeze solid in winter — mulch heavily or empty and cover
- Season extension tools (cold frames, hoop covers) integrate easily with raised beds

### Arid Climates

- Sunken raised beds (below grade) can actually help retain moisture
- Heavy mulching is critical
- Drip irrigation on a timer prevents inconsistent watering

## Budget Breakdown: What It Really Costs

### A Single 4×8×12-inch Cedar Bed

| Item | Cost Estimate |
|------|--------------|
| Cedar lumber (2×12, 8-foot boards × 4) | $80–120 |
| Hardware (screws, corner brackets) | $15–25 |
| Soil mix (32 cu ft bulk delivery) | $60–100 |
| Mulch (3 cu ft bag × 3) | $15–20 |
| Drip irrigation kit | $25–40 |
| Seeds and transplants | $20–40 |
| **Total** | **$215–345** |

### Budget Alternative: Pine + Bulk Soil

| Item | Cost Estimate |
|------|--------------|
| Pine lumber (2×12, 8-foot boards × 4) | $30–50 |
| Hardware | $10–15 |
| Bulk topsoil + compost (delivered) | $40–80 |
| **Total** | **$80–145** |

The investment pays for itself within a season or two of vegetable production — and the beds last for years.
