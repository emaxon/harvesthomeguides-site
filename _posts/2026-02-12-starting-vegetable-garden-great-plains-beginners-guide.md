New to gardening on the Great Plains? Start here. This guide assumes you've never grown a vegetable in your life and you're working with a patch of Great Plains ground somewhere between Oklahoma and North Dakota. No judgment, no jargon, just clear steps to get food growing this year.

## Step 1: Pick Your Spot

You need three things from a garden location:

**Sunlight:** At least 6 hours of direct sun daily. Eight hours is better. Most vegetables won't produce in shade. Walk outside at 9 AM, noon, and 3 PM on a sunny day and note which areas get direct light at all three times. That's your garden spot.

**Access to water.** You'll be watering regularly from June through September. If you have to drag a 200-foot hose across the yard every time, you won't do it. Put your garden within easy reach of a spigot.

**[wind](/blog/growing-vegetables-great-plains-wind-and-heat) protection.** If your chosen spot is wide open to the west or northwest, you'll struggle. A fence, building wall, hedge, or row of trees on the windward side makes a dramatic difference. If you don't have natural protection, plan to build a simple windbreak — even straw bales stacked along one side help.

## Step 2: Start Small

The number one beginner mistake is planting too much. A 4×8-foot raised bed or a 10×10-foot in-ground plot is plenty for your first year. This sounds small, but a well-managed 4×8 bed can produce 50-100 pounds of vegetables in a season.

**Why small works:**
- Less overwhelming to maintain
- Less weeding, less watering, less everything
- You learn faster when you can observe every plant closely
- You can always expand next year

## Step 3: Prepare the Soil

Great Plains soil usually needs help. Here's the minimum for your first year:

1. **Remove the sod.** If you're converting lawn, cut the grass short, then strip the sod with a flat shovel. Flip the sod pieces upside down in a pile — they'll compost into good soil in a year.

2. **Loosen the ground.** Use a garden fork or shovel to turn over and break up the top 10-12 inches of soil. Remove rocks bigger than your fist.

3. **Add compost.** Spread 3-4 inches of compost over your loosened soil and mix it in. Bags of compost from any garden center work fine. For a 4×8 bed, you need about 8-10 bags (1 cubic foot each). For a 10×10 plot, about 25 bags — or save money and buy a cubic yard of bulk compost from a landscape supply company.

4. **Rake it smooth.** You want a level, loose planting surface.

**If you're building a raised bed:** Construct a simple frame from untreated lumber (2×10 or 2×12 boards), fill with a 50/50 mix of garden soil and compost, and you're ready to plant. This skips the sod-removal and soil-amendment steps entirely.

## Step 4: Choose Easy Crops

For your first Great Plains garden, stick with these forgiving, productive vegetables:

### The Beginner Five

**1. Bush beans (Provider or Blue Lake Bush)**
Why: Direct sow into the ground (no transplanting), fast to mature (50-60 days), heavy producers, and almost foolproof. Plant seeds 1 inch deep, 4 inches apart, after your last frost date. Water regularly. Pick beans when they're pencil-sized.

**2. Zucchini (Black Beauty or Dark Star)**
Why: Ridiculously productive. Two plants will feed a family. Direct sow or transplant after last frost. Space plants 3 feet apart. Your challenge won't be growing zucchini — it'll be using it all.

**3. Tomatoes (Celebrity or Early Girl)**
Why: Every beginner wants tomatoes, and these two varieties are reliable across the entire Great Plains. Buy transplants from a local garden center — don't try to start from seed your first year. Plant after last frost, bury the stem up to the lowest set of leaves (tomatoes root along the buried stem), cage or stake immediately.

**4. Lettuce (a mix of leaf varieties)**
Why: Fast (30-45 days to harvest), grows in cool weather, and you can cut leaves and they'll regrow. Sow seeds in early spring as soon as soil can be worked, and again in late August for fall harvest. Lettuce quits when summer heat arrives — that's normal, not failure.

**5. Radishes (Cherry Belle or French Breakfast)**
Why: Ready in 25-30 days. Seriously. You'll have food from your garden less than a month after planting. Sow seeds in early spring, thin to 2 inches apart, and harvest when the roots are marble-sized. Great for impatient beginners.

## Step 5: Know Your Timing

Great Plains planting dates vary by state and location. Here are approximate last spring frost dates — the baseline for warm-season planting:

| Location | Avg. Last Frost |
|----------|----------------|
| Oklahoma City, OK | Mar 28 |
| Wichita, KS | Apr 10 |
| Lincoln, NE | Apr 20 |
| Sioux Falls, SD | May 5 |
| Fargo, ND | May 13 |
| Bismarck, ND | May 14 |

**Cool-season crops** (lettuce, radishes, peas) can go in the ground 4-6 weeks before last frost. They handle light frost.

**Warm-season crops** (tomatoes, peppers, beans, squash) go out after last frost, when soil is warm. Don't rush this — cold soil kills warm-season plants slowly and painfully.

**Find your specific date** at your county extension office or search "[your city] last frost date" online.

## Step 6: Water Correctly

Most beginner garden failures come down to watering — either too little or too much.

**The simple rule:** Most vegetables need about 1 inch of water per week, including rainfall. In the Great Plains summer, rain often isn't enough, so you'll supplement.

**How to water well:**
- Water in the morning (before 9 AM). This gives plants time to dry before evening, reducing disease.
- Water the soil, not the leaves. A soaker hose or drip tape laid along your rows is ideal. A watering can or gentle hose spray works too — just aim at the base of plants.
- Water deeply, less often. A thorough soaking every 3-4 days beats a light sprinkle every day. Deep water encourages deep roots, which helps plants survive hot, windy afternoons.

**How to check:** Push your finger into the soil. If the top 2 inches are dry, water. If it's moist, wait.

## Step 7: Mulch Everything

After your plants are up and growing (about 4-6 inches tall), spread 3-4 inches of straw, grass clippings, or shredded leaves around them. Keep mulch an inch away from plant stems.

Mulching is the closest thing to a magic trick in Great Plains gardening:
- Reduces watering needs by 25-50%
- Keeps roots cool in summer heat
- Suppresses weeds (less work for you)
- Prevents soil from crusting and cracking

## Step 8: Handle the Inevitable Problems

**Weeds:** Pull them when they're small. Mulch prevents most of them. Spend 10 minutes every other day on weed patrol and you'll stay ahead.

**Insects:** Most bugs in your garden are harmless or beneficial. Don't spray anything unless you've identified an actual pest causing actual damage. Hand-pick large pests (hornworms, squash bugs) and drop them in soapy water.

**Heat stress:** When temperatures exceed 95°F, some plants will wilt in the afternoon even with adequate water. This is normal — they're conserving moisture. If they bounce back by morning, they're fine. If they're still wilted at dawn, water deeply.

**Hail:** Keep a sheet of row cover or an old bedsheet handy. When storms threaten, drape it over your plants. It won't stop golf-ball hail, but it handles pea-sized stuff.

## What to Expect Your First Year

Be realistic: your first garden won't be perfect. Some things will fail. Bugs will eat something. The weather will do something unfair.

But you'll also eat your first homegrown tomato and realize it doesn't taste anything like what comes from the store. You'll cut lettuce for a salad that was growing in dirt ten minutes ago. You'll hand a zucchini to your neighbor because you have too many.

That's the hook. It gets you every time.

Next year you'll want a bigger garden. That's how it starts. Welcome to growing food on the Great Plains.
