While the rest of the country is dreaming about tomato season, PNW gardeners are knee-deep in kale, harvesting overwintered broccoli, and picking fava beans. Cool-season crops aren't a consolation prize here — they're the main event.

The Pacific Northwest's mild, wet winters (USDA Zones 8a–8b across most lowland areas of western Washington, Oregon, and southwestern BC) create ideal conditions for vegetables that prefer temperatures between 40°F and 70°F. That's roughly eight months of the year. If you're only gardening from May to September, you're using less than half of your available growing season.

Here are the best cool-season crops for PNW gardens, ranked by productivity, reliability, and how little they'll make you suffer.

## Tier 1: Plant These First

### Kale

If you grow one thing in a PNW garden, grow kale. It's not a trend — it's a climate match. Kale tolerates temperatures down to 10°F, actually tastes better after frost (cold converts starches to sugars), and produces continuously from a single planting for 8–12 months.

**Best varieties for PNW:** 'Red Russian' (tender, mild, best for salads), 'Lacinato/Dinosaur' (classic Tuscan kale, handles cold beautifully), 'Winterbor' (curly type, incredibly cold-hardy).

**When to plant:** Direct seed March–April for summer harvest, or July–August for fall and winter harvest. Transplants can go in anytime from March through September.

**Harvest method:** Pick outer leaves and let the center keep growing. A single kale plant can produce for an entire year.

### Peas (Snap, Snow, and Shelling)

Peas are the crop that makes PNW gardeners feel smug. While gardeners in hot climates get maybe four weeks of pea harvest before the heat shuts them down, PNW peas produce from June through July — sometimes into August if the summer stays cool.

**Best varieties:** 'Cascadia' snap pea (bred at Oregon State University specifically for this region), 'Oregon Sugar Pod II' snow pea, 'Alderman/Tall Telephone' shelling pea.

**When to plant:** Direct seed February–April. Peas germinate in soil as cool as 40°F, so you can plant them absurdly early. A second succession planting in late July can yield a fall harvest before frost.

**Pro Tip:** Inoculate seed with rhizobium bacteria before planting. PNW soils often lack the right nitrogen-fixing bacteria for peas, and inoculation makes a noticeable difference in yield.

### Garlic

Fall-planted garlic is the easiest crop in the PNW, and it's one of the most valuable per square foot. Plant cloves in October, ignore them all winter, harvest in July. The mild, wet winter provides exactly the cold stratification and consistent moisture garlic needs.

**Best varieties:** Hardneck types excel here — 'Music,' 'Chesnok Red,' 'German Extra Hardy,' and the locally beloved 'Inchelium Red' (which originated in Washington state). Softneck varieties ('Silverskin,' 'California Early') also do well and store longer.

**When to plant:** October 1–November 15. Earlier is better — cloves need to root before the ground gets cold.

**Spacing:** 6 inches apart, 2 inches deep, pointy end up. Mulch with 3–4 inches of straw after planting.

### Fava Beans

Fava beans are the PNW's underappreciated workhorse. They fix nitrogen in the soil, tolerate temperatures down to about 15°F (established plants), and produce a heavy crop of protein-rich beans in late spring — exactly when little else is ready to harvest.

**Best varieties:** 'Aquadulce Claudia' (most cold-hardy, best for fall planting), 'Windsor' (classic large-seeded variety), 'Sweet Lorane' (small-seeded, used as cover crop and food crop simultaneously).

**When to plant:** October–November for the largest harvest. You can also plant February–March for a later, slightly smaller crop.

**Warning:** Favas get aphids. Every year, without fail, you'll see clusters of black bean aphids on the growing tips around May. Pinch off the affected tips — the plants are done growing upward by then anyway, and pinching redirects energy into pod filling.

## Tier 2: Highly Productive

### Broccoli and Cauliflower

Overwintering brassicas are a PNW specialty. Transplant them in August or early September, and they'll size up before winter, then burst into production in February and March — months before spring-planted brassicas even go into the ground.

**Best overwintering varieties:** 'Purple Sprouting' broccoli (the king of overwintering brassicas — incredibly reliable), 'Walcheren Winter' cauliflower, 'Romanesco' (plant early, it needs time).

**Best spring varieties:** 'Belstar' broccoli, 'Arcadia' broccoli (excellent side-shoot production), 'Snow Crown' cauliflower.

**Pest note:** Cabbage moths are active [year-round gardening](/blog/year-round-vegetable-gardening-pacific-northwest) in the PNW. Cover brassicas with insect netting from transplant day onward, or you'll be picking caterpillars out of your florets forever.

### Lettuce and Salad Greens

Lettuce grows year-round in the PNW with minimal protection. The key is matching variety to season:

- **Spring/Fall:** Butterheads and romaines ('Winter Density,' 'Rouge d'Hiver,' 'North Pole')
- **Summer:** Bolt-resistant varieties ('Jericho,' 'Muir,' 'Concept') — even these may bolt in an unusually hot August
- **Winter:** Hardy varieties under a simple cloche or cold frame ('Winter Marvel,' 'Arctic King')

**Succession planting is essential.** Sow a short row every 2–3 weeks from March through September. You'll never have too much lettuce at once, and you'll never run out.

### Spinach

True spinach (not the warm-season pretenders like Malabar spinach) loves the PNW. It bolts in heat, so it's a terrible summer crop here — but from September through May, it's one of the most productive greens you can grow.

**Best varieties:** 'Bloomsdale Long Standing' (classic crinkly leaf), 'Tyee' (excellent bolt resistance for spring), 'Giant Winter' (exactly what the name says — huge leaves, cold-tolerant).

**When to plant:** Direct seed September–October for fall/winter harvest, February–March for spring harvest. Skip June through August entirely.

## Tier 3: Worth the Space

### Leeks

Leeks take forever — 90 to 120 days from transplant — but they're one of the most cold-hardy alliums and produce through the entire PNW winter. Start seeds indoors in February, transplant in May, and harvest from October through March.

**Best varieties:** 'King Richard' (fastest, but less cold-hardy), 'Bandit' (thick stems, very hardy), 'Bleu de Solaise' (French heirloom, turns blue-purple in cold — stunning and delicious).

**Growing trick:** Plant leeks in a 6-inch trench and gradually hill soil around the stems as they grow. This blanches the lower shaft, giving you more white, tender leek per plant.

### Carrots

Carrots thrive in the PNW's cool soil, but they need better drainage than most cool-season crops. Raised beds or deeply amended soil with good sand or pumice content are essential — carrots fork and twist in heavy clay.

**When to plant:** Direct seed April–July for summer and fall harvest. Carrots planted in June–July and left in the ground through winter actually get sweeter as cold temperatures trigger sugar production in the roots.

**Best varieties:** 'Napoli' (early, sweet, reliable), 'Bolero' (excellent storage carrot), 'Danvers 126' (handles heavier soil better than most).

### Beets

Like carrots but more forgiving of heavy soil. Beets handle PNW clay reasonably well and tolerate light frost. You also get two crops from one planting — roots and greens.

**When to plant:** Direct seed April–July. Beets planted in July can be harvested well into November.

**Best varieties:** 'Detroit Dark Red' (the standard for good reason), 'Chioggia' (gorgeous candy-striped interior), 'Cylindra' (uniform slices, great for pickling).

## Cool-Season Crops That Surprise People

A few crops that most people associate with warm climates actually perform well in PNW cool seasons:

- **Cilantro:** Bolts instantly in heat but thrives October–May. Plant it as a fall/winter herb and you'll have more than you can use.
- **Radishes:** Ready in 25–30 days, plantable March–May and September–October. 'Watermelon' and 'Black Spanish' radishes are excellent fall varieties that store well.
- **Turnips:** The Japanese salad turnip 'Hakurei' is a revelation — sweet, crisp, ready in 35 days. Direct seed spring or fall.
- **Chard:** More cold-tolerant than most people realize. 'Fordhook Giant' and 'Bright Lights' produce through mild PNW winters with no protection.

## Planning Your Cool-Season Garden

A 4x8 raised bed dedicated to cool-season crops can feed two people a significant amount of greens and vegetables from September through May. Here's a sample layout:

- **Row 1:** Kale (3 plants, staggered spacing) — harvest all winter
- **Row 2:** Overwintering broccoli (2 plants) — harvest February–April
- **Row 3:** Spinach/lettuce mix (direct seeded) — harvest October–March
- **Row 4:** Garlic (planted October, harvest July) or fava beans (planted November, harvest May)

Rotate crops annually, add compost between plantings, and you'll build soil fertility while eating well through the months most gardeners write off as "off-season."

The PNW doesn't have an off-season. It just has a season most people haven't learned to use yet.
