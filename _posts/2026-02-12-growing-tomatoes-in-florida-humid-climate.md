Florida tomato growers face a unique challenge: the state that produces more commercial tomatoes than almost anywhere in the U.S. is also one of the hardest places to grow them in a backyard. The humidity fuels fungal diseases. The heat shuts down fruit set. The rain spreads bacterial infections like wildfire.

But thousands of Florida gardeners grow incredible tomatoes every year. The difference between success and a sad, wilted mess comes down to **variety selection, timing, and disease management**. Get those three right and you'll be harvesting more tomatoes than you can eat.

## Why Florida Is Hard on Tomatoes

Before we get into solutions, let's understand the problems:

- **Blossom drop.** When nighttime temperatures stay above 75°F, tomato flowers abort. They simply fall off without setting fruit. This is the #1 frustration for Florida tomato growers.
- **Fungal diseases.** Florida's humidity (often 80–100% in the morning) creates perfect conditions for early blight, late blight, septoria leaf spot, and target spot.
- **Bacterial wilt.** This soil-borne disease kills plants fast, and there's no chemical treatment. It thrives in warm, wet soil — which describes most of Florida most of the year.
- **Nematodes.** Root-knot nematodes are endemic in Florida's [sandy soil](/blog/vegetables-for-florida-sandy-soil). They damage roots, stunting plants and reducing harvests.
- **Whiteflies and hornworms.** [organic [pest management](/blog/managing-florida-garden-pests-organically)](/blog/managing-florida-garden-pests-organically) pressure is intense year-round.

Sound grim? It's not. Every one of these problems has a practical solution.

## The Two Tomato Windows

Forget summer tomatoes. In Florida, you grow tomatoes in **fall and late winter/spring** — and you race to harvest before the heat shuts everything down.

### North Florida (Zones 8b–9a)

- **Spring planting:** Set transplants out in mid-February to early March. Harvest from May through mid-June before the heat kills production.
- **Fall planting:** Set transplants out in mid-August to early September. Harvest from October through November (or into December in mild years).

### Central Florida (Zones 9a–9b)

- **Spring planting:** Transplants go out in late January to mid-February. Harvest from April through early June.
- **Fall planting:** Transplants out in late August to mid-September. Harvest October through December.

### South Florida (Zones 10a–10b)

- **Winter planting:** This is your main season. Transplants go out October through January. Harvest December through April.
- **There is no summer season.** Don't fight it. The combination of heat, humidity, and rain makes summer tomato growing in South Florida an exercise in frustration.

## Best Tomato Varieties for Florida

Generic "Big Boy" and "Better Boy" varieties from the garden center will struggle. You need **disease-resistant varieties bred for hot, humid conditions**. Look for these resistance codes on the label: V (verticillium), F (fusarium), N (nematode), T (tobacco mosaic), and TSWV (tomato spotted wilt virus).

### Top Performers

- **Solar Fire.** Developed by the University of Florida specifically for Florida conditions. Sets fruit in higher heat than most varieties. Determinate, 70 days.
- **Florida 91.** Another UF release. Excellent disease resistance, good flavor for a hybrid. Determinate, 72 days.
- **Heat Master.** Sets fruit at temperatures that shut down other varieties. Disease-resistant. Determinate, 75 days.
- **Everglades (Florida Native).** A cherry tomato that's practically bulletproof. Produces prolifically with minimal care. It self-seeds and comes back year after year. Indeterminate.
- **Sweet 100/Sun Gold.** Cherry tomatoes that handle Florida conditions better than large-fruited varieties. More forgiving of heat and humidity.
- **BHN 602.** Popular with commercial growers in Florida. Outstanding disease resistance. Large fruit. Determinate, 72 days.
- **Bella Rosa.** Excellent bacterial spot resistance — a major advantage in Florida. Determinate, 75 days.

### Varieties to Avoid

Skip heirloom varieties like Brandywine, Cherokee Purple, and Mortgage Lifter unless you're willing to spray fungicides regularly and accept lower yields. They have zero disease resistance and the Florida humidity will destroy them.

## Starting Right: Soil and Planting

Florida's sandy soil drains fast and holds almost no nutrients. Tomatoes need better than that.

**Amend your beds.** Mix in 3–4 inches of compost before planting. This improves water retention and adds nutrients. Repeat every season.

**Raise your beds.** Even 6–8 inches of raised bed height improves drainage during Florida's torrential rains. Waterlogged roots invite disease.

**Check your pH.** Florida soil is often alkaline (pH 7.0–8.0) due to underlying limestone. Tomatoes prefer 6.0–6.5. Add sulfur to lower pH if needed based on a soil test.

**Space plants 24–36 inches apart.** Air circulation is your best defense against fungal disease. Don't crowd them.

**Mulch heavily.** A 3-inch layer of straw or wood chips keeps soil moisture consistent, suppresses weeds, and — critically — prevents rain from splashing soil-borne diseases onto lower leaves.

## Disease Prevention: The Florida Survival Plan

In Florida, you don't react to disease. You **prevent it**. Once fungal or bacterial infections take hold, you're fighting a losing battle.

### Daily Practices

- **Water at the base, never overhead.** Drip irrigation or soaker hoses are ideal. Wet foliage in Florida's humidity is an invitation for every fungal disease in the book.
- **Water in the morning.** If you must use a sprinkler, water early so leaves dry before the afternoon humidity spike.
- **Prune lower branches.** Remove all foliage below 12 inches. This prevents soil splash from infecting leaves.
- **Remove suckers for better airflow.** Keeping plants to one or two main stems improves circulation.

### Weekly Practices

- **Scout for disease.** Check lower leaves for spots, yellowing, or lesions. Remove affected leaves immediately and dispose of them in the trash — not the compost.
- **Apply preventive fungicide.** Copper-based fungicides (organic-approved) applied weekly before symptoms appear are far more effective than treating active infections. Chlorothalonil is a conventional option that works well.
- **Rotate crops.** Never plant tomatoes (or peppers, eggplant, or potatoes) in the same spot two seasons in a row. This reduces soil-borne disease buildup.

### Nematode Management

Root-knot nematodes are a fact of life in Florida's sandy soil. Here's what helps:

- **Plant nematode-resistant varieties** (look for the "N" on the label).
- **Solarize soil** between seasons by covering beds with clear plastic for 4–6 weeks during summer. The heat kills nematodes in the top several inches.
- **Add organic matter.** Compost and cover crops support beneficial organisms that compete with nematodes.
- **Use grafted tomatoes.** Heirloom tops grafted onto disease-resistant rootstock give you the flavor you want with the root system that survives Florida soil.

## Fertilizing for Florida's Sandy Soil

Sandy soil doesn't hold nutrients. A single heavy rain can leach fertilizer right past the root zone. The solution: **fertilize lightly and often**.

- **At planting:** Mix a slow-release fertilizer (like 8-2-12 or similar) into the planting hole.
- **Every 2–3 weeks:** Side-dress with a balanced fertilizer or apply liquid fertilizer through your drip system.
- **Watch for magnesium deficiency.** It's common in Florida soil. Yellowing between leaf veins on older leaves is the telltale sign. Epsom salt (1 tablespoon per gallon, applied as a foliar spray) corrects it quickly.
- **Add calcium.** Blossom end rot — that black, sunken spot on the bottom of the fruit — is a calcium uptake issue often caused by inconsistent watering. Maintain even soil moisture and add calcium (gypsum or calcium sulfate) if soil tests show a deficiency.

## Beating the Heat: Extending Your Season

When temperatures climb, you have a few tricks:

- **Shade cloth.** A 30% shade cloth over your tomato plants can reduce leaf temperature by 10°F, extending production by several weeks.
- **Heat-setting varieties.** Solar Fire and Heat Master continue setting fruit at temperatures that shut down other varieties.
- **Cherry tomatoes.** Small-fruited varieties tolerate heat better than beefsteak types. When your big tomatoes stop producing, cherry tomatoes keep going.

## The Bottom Line

Growing tomatoes in Florida isn't harder than growing them elsewhere — it's just different. Choose disease-resistant varieties bred for Florida. Plant during the right windows. Prevent disease before it starts. Manage your sandy soil with compost and consistent feeding.

Do these things and you'll harvest more tomatoes than your neighbors who planted a Better Boy in May and wondered why it died by July.
