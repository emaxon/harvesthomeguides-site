## Why Generic Spring Checklists Don't Work

Every spring, gardening websites publish "Spring Planting Guide!" articles that treat the entire United States as one garden. "Plant tomatoes in March!" they say — which is perfect for Zone 9 and a death sentence in Zone 5.

Your spring checklist needs to be based on your **USDA hardiness zone** and your **last average frost date.** These two data points determine everything about your spring garden timing.

### How to Find Your Zone and Frost Date

1. **USDA Zone:** Enter your zip code at the USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map (planthardiness.ars.usda.gov)
2. **Last frost date:** Search "[your county] + last frost date" or contact your county extension service

## Zone 3–4: The Short-Season Sprint (Last Frost: May 15–June 1)

## Universal Spring Checklist (All Zones)

Regardless of your zone, these tasks apply every spring:

### Soil Preparation
- [ ] Test soil (pH, nutrients) — do this every 2–3 years at minimum
- [ ] Add 2–3 inches of compost to beds and work in
- [ ] Amend pH if needed (lime for acidic, sulfur for alkaline)
- [ ] Check drainage — fix any waterlogging issues before planting

### Infrastructure
- [ ] Repair or replace [raised beds](/blog/raised-bed-vegetable-gardening-for-beginners), fences, and trellises
- [ ] Clean and sharpen tools
- [ ] Check irrigation systems for leaks and clogs
- [ ] Install new support structures (tomato cages, bean poles)
- [ ] Set up rain gauges to monitor natural precipitation

### Planning
- [ ] Map your garden layout with crop rotation in mind
- [ ] Order seeds early — popular varieties sell out
- [ ] Check seed viability (most seeds last 2–5 years if stored properly)
- [ ] Plan succession plantings for continuous harvest
- [ ] Set up a garden journal or tracking system

### Planting Fundamentals
- [ ] Harden off all indoor-started transplants for 7–10 days before planting out
- [ ] Plant in the morning or evening, never midday
- [ ] Water transplants immediately after planting
- [ ] Mulch all beds 2–3 inches deep
- [ ] Label everything — you will forget what you planted where

### Ongoing Care
- [ ] Scout for pests weekly — catch problems early
- [ ] Keep on top of weeds — they steal water and nutrients
- [ ] Water deeply and consistently (1 inch per week, adjusted for rain)
- [ ] Feed heavy feeders (tomatoes, peppers, squash) monthly with organic fertilizer
- [ ] Succession plant lettuce, radishes, beans every 2–3 weeks

## The One Thing Every Zone Has in Common

Whether you're in Zone 3 or Zone 10, the same principle applies: **plant the right thing at the right time for your specific location.** Generic advice kills gardens. Regional, zone-specific guidance grows them.

That's exactly why we created Harvest Home Guides — to give every gardener a month-by-month plan tailored to their region.

*For a complete regional growing guide with month-by-month detail, check out the [Harvest Home Guides book series](/books/). Texas is coming first, with more regions to follow.*
