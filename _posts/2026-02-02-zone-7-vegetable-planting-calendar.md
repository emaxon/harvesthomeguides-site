## Understanding Zone 7

USDA Zone 7 covers a wide band across the United States:

- **Zone 7a** (0–5°F minimum): Parts of Virginia, [North Carolina](/blog/when-to-plant-vegetables-in-the-southeast), Tennessee, Arkansas, Oklahoma, [North Texas](/blog/when-to-plant-vegetables-in-texas-zone-by-zone-guide), New Mexico, and the Pacific Northwest
- **Zone 7b** (5–10°F minimum): Parts of the same states, generally slightly warmer microclimates

**Average last spring frost:** April 1–15
**Average first fall frost:** October 25–November 10
**Growing season:** 180–210 days

Zone 7 is the sweet spot — warm enough for tomatoes, peppers, and melons but cold enough for excellent cool-season crops. You get true four-season gardening potential.

## January: Planning and Early Seeds

**Indoor tasks:**
- Order seeds if you haven't already — popular varieties sell out
- Start onion seeds indoors (10–12 weeks before transplant)
- Start leek seeds indoors
- Review last year's garden notes. What worked? What didn't?

**Outdoor tasks:**
- Prune dormant fruit trees and berry bushes
- Check stored garlic and potatoes for sprouting
- Cover overwintering crops (spinach, kale) during extreme cold snaps
- Turn compost pile on mild days

**Harvest:** Overwintered kale, collards, spinach (with protection)

## February: The Starting Gun

**Start indoors (under lights):**
- Peppers (8–10 weeks before last frost) — first 2 weeks of February
- Eggplant (8–10 weeks before last frost) — first 2 weeks of February
- Tomatoes (6–8 weeks before last frost) — last 2 weeks of February
- Broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage for spring planting

**Direct sow outdoors (late February, if soil is workable):**
- Peas — they tolerate frost and benefit from early planting
- Spinach — direct sow as soon as soil can be worked
- Radishes
- Lettuce (under row cover for protection)

**Outdoor tasks:**
- Prepare beds: add compost, check pH, amend as needed
- Set up trellises for peas
- Start hardening off any overwintered cold frames

## March: Things Get Real

**Start indoors:**
- More tomatoes if needed (early March)
- Cucumbers, squash, melons (late March, 3–4 weeks before transplant)
- Herbs: basil, parsley, cilantro

**Direct sow outdoors:**
- Peas (if not planted in February)
- Lettuce, spinach, arugula
- Carrots (mid-to-late March)
- Beets
- Radishes
- Kale and collards for spring
- Swiss chard
- Potatoes (St. Patrick's Day is the traditional Zone 7 planting date)
- Onion sets and transplants (mid-March)

**Transplant outdoors (with protection):**
- Broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage transplants (mid-March, under row cover)

**Key reminder:** Watch the weather. Zone 7 can still get hard freezes through mid-March. Have row covers or frost cloth ready.

## April: Prime Planting Month

April is the busiest month in a Zone 7 garden. The risk of frost drops rapidly, and warm-season planting begins.

**After last frost (April 1–15):**
- Transplant tomatoes outdoors
- Transplant peppers outdoors
- Transplant eggplant outdoors
- Direct sow bush beans
- Direct sow corn (soil temperature 60°F+)

**Continue direct sowing:**
- Carrots (succession plant)
- Beets (succession plant)
- Lettuce (switch to heat-tolerant varieties)
- Radishes
- Swiss chard

**Late April:**
- Direct sow cucumbers (soil temp 65°F+)
- Direct sow squash and zucchini
- Transplant herbs (basil, parsley)
- Direct sow dill, cilantro

**Tasks:**
- Install tomato cages/stakes at planting time
- Mulch everything — 3 inches minimum
- Set up drip irrigation if using it
- Watch for late frost warnings and protect tender transplants

## May: Full Throttle

**Direct sow:**
- Pole beans and lima beans
- Southern peas/cowpeas (mid-May when soil is warm)
- Okra (needs warm soil, 65°F+)
- Sweet potato slips (after soil warms)
- Watermelon and cantaloupe (direct sow or transplant)
- Summer squash succession planting

**Transplant:**
- Any remaining tomatoes, peppers, eggplant
- Herb transplants

**Tasks:**
- Side-dress spring-planted crops with compost or organic fertilizer
- Watch for pests: aphids, flea beetles, cabbage worms on brassicas
- Harvest spring lettuce, spinach, radishes before they bolt
- Start planning your fall garden (yes, already)

**Harvest:** Lettuce, spinach, radishes, peas, asparagus, strawberries

## June: Growth and Early Harvest

**Plant:**
- Succession plant bush beans every 2–3 weeks
- Succession plant cucumbers
- Last plantings of squash and okra
- Southern peas

**Tasks:**
- Stake and tie tomato plants as they grow
- Remove suckers from indeterminate tomatoes (or don't — there are arguments both ways)
- Deep water established plants during dry spells (1 inch per week)
- Scout for squash vine borers — wrap stems, use Bt injections
- Harvest garlic when lower leaves brown (typically mid-June)
- Pull spring brassicas as they bolt

**Harvest:** Peas, lettuce (final), strawberries, garlic, early beans, early squash, first cherry tomatoes

## July: Peak Production and Fall Planning

**Plant:**
- Bush beans (last succession for spring/summer)
- Southern peas
- Start fall broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage seeds indoors (late July)
- Start fall tomato seeds indoors (mid-July) for transplanting in August

**Tasks:**
- Water consistently — July heat is intense in Zone 7
- Apply shade cloth over heat-stressed plants
- Harvest squash and beans regularly to keep plants producing
- Pull spent spring crops and compost them
- Begin preparing beds for fall planting: add compost, remove weeds

**Harvest:** Tomatoes, peppers, squash, cucumbers, beans, eggplant, corn, okra, melons (late July)

## August: The Fall Transition

August is the second busiest planting month. While summer crops are still producing, fall planting begins.

**Transplant outdoors:**
- Fall broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage (early August)
- Fall tomatoes (early August, Zone 7b; risky in 7a)

**Direct sow:**
- Bush beans (August 1 — last chance for fall harvest before frost)
- Cucumbers (early August, quick-maturing varieties)
- Lettuce (start under shade cloth, move to full sun as temperatures cool)
- Kale and collards (direct sow or transplant mid-August)
- Beets
- Carrots
- Turnips
- Rutabaga

**Tasks:**
- Provide shade cloth for new fall transplants
- Water fall seedlings consistently
- Continue harvesting summer crops
- Remove any diseased plants promptly

**Harvest:** Peak tomato season, peppers, eggplant, okra, melons, beans, corn

## September: Fall Garden Hits Its Stride

**Direct sow:**
- Lettuce, spinach, arugula (direct sow throughout September)
- Radishes
- Turnips
- Asian greens (bok choy, tatsoi, mizuna)
- Cover crops in beds you're done with (crimson clover, winter rye)

**Transplant:**
- Any remaining brassica transplants (early September)

**Plant:**
- Garlic (late September through October)

**Tasks:**
- Remove spent summer crops as they finish
- Add compost to emptied beds
- Reduce watering as temperatures cool (but don't stop — fall crops still need moisture)
- Start saving seeds from open-pollinated varieties

**Harvest:** Tomatoes (late season), peppers, fall beans, fall broccoli (early planted), lettuce, kale

## October: Cool-Season Abundance

**Plant:**
- Garlic cloves (October is prime time in Zone 7)
- Onion seeds indoors for spring transplanting
- Spinach (direct sow for overwintering)
- Lettuce (last sowings for fall harvest)
- Cover crops for winter

**Tasks:**
- Harvest remaining warm-season crops before first frost
- Protect frost-tender plants with row covers if frost comes early
- Leave frost-tolerant crops in the ground — kale, collards, carrots, beets, turnips, spinach
- Clean and store tomato cages, stakes, and supports
- Add leaves and compost to beds as mulch

**Harvest:** Kale, collards, lettuce, carrots, beets, turnips, radishes, fall broccoli, final tomatoes and peppers

## November: Wind Down and Winterize

**Plant:**
- Garlic (last chance, through mid-November)
- Overwinter spinach and lettuce under cold frames or row covers

**Tasks:**
- Mulch garlic beds with 4–6 inches of straw or leaves
- Spread leaves over empty beds (free mulch and soil amendment)
- Clean, sharpen, and oil tools for storage
- Drain and store irrigation lines if freezing is a concern
- Take soil tests for spring planning
- Order seed catalogs

**Harvest:** Kale (peak flavor after frost), collards, spinach, carrots (leave in ground until needed), Brussels sprouts, leeks

## December: Rest, Plan, Dream

**Tasks:**
- Harvest overwintered greens as needed
- Check cold frames and row covers after storms
- Plan next year's garden layout
- Order seeds early for best selection
- Review and update your garden journal

## Zone 7 Growing Tips

### Extending the Season

Zone 7 gets cold enough that season extension tools make a real difference:

- **Cold frames:** Extend lettuce, spinach, and carrot harvests well into December and even through winter
- **Row covers (frost cloth):** Add 4–8°F of protection. Keep cool-season crops growing through November
- **Black plastic mulch:** Warms soil for earlier spring planting of warm-season crops
- **Wall-O-Water or similar:** Protect individual tomato transplants from late frosts, allowing planting 2–3 weeks earlier

### Succession Planting

Don't plant everything at once. Stagger plantings of these crops every 2–3 weeks:
- Lettuce
- Radishes
- Bush beans
- Carrots
- Beets

This gives you continuous harvests instead of a glut followed by nothing.

### Soil Management

Zone 7 soils vary wildly by location. Get a soil test and follow the recommendations. Generally:
- Add 2–3 inches of compost every spring and fall
- Use cover crops in winter to prevent erosion and add organic matter
- Mulch heavily to moderate soil temperature and retain moisture

Zone 7 is one of the best gardening zones in America. Use this calendar, stay consistent, and you'll be eating from your garden 9–10 months of the year.
