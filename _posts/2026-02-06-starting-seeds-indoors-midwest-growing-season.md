It's February in the Midwest. The ground is frozen, the seed catalogs are dog-eared, and you're wondering if it's too early to start tomatoes. The answer is probably yes — but not for much longer.

Starting seeds indoors is the single best way to extend your Midwest growing season. With last frost dates ranging from late April in southern Missouri to late May in northern Wisconsin and Minnesota, indoor seed starting gives you a 6–10 week head start on crops that would otherwise never ripen before fall frost shuts everything down.

Here's how to do it right — timing, setup, and the mistakes that kill seedlings before they ever see your garden.

## Know Your Last Frost Date

Every decision about when to start seeds flows from one number: your average last frost date. Here's what you're working with across the Midwest:

- **Southern Missouri/Southern Illinois (Zones 6b-7a):** April 5–15
- **Central Indiana/Central Ohio/Central Illinois (Zone 6a):** April 20–May 1
- **Northern Ohio/Southern Michigan/Southern Wisconsin/Iowa (Zone 5b):** May 1–10
- **Northern Michigan/Northern Wisconsin/Minnesota (Zones 4a-4b):** May 15–30

These are averages. Some years you'll get a killing frost two weeks after your "safe" date. That's the Midwest for you — plan for the average, but have frost protection ready.

## The Seed-Starting Calendar

Count backwards from your last frost date. That's the entire system. Here's your cheat sheet:

### 10–12 Weeks Before Last Frost
- **Onions** (from seed)
- **Leeks**
- **Celery**

These are slow growers that need every bit of lead time. If your last frost is May 10, you're starting these in mid-to-late February.

### 8–10 Weeks Before Last Frost
- **Peppers** (all types)
- **Eggplant**

Peppers are notoriously slow to germinate and grow. Most Midwest gardeners start them too late. If you're in Zone 5b with a May 10 last frost, pepper seeds should be in soil by early March at the latest.

### 6–8 Weeks Before Last Frost
- **Tomatoes**
- **Broccoli**
- **Cauliflower**
- **Cabbage**
- **Kale** (for transplanting)

Tomatoes are the crop everyone starts too early. A leggy, rootbound tomato transplant performs worse than a compact, 6-week-old plant. Resist the urge.

### 4–6 Weeks Before Last Frost
- **Lettuce**
- **Swiss chard**
- **Herbs** (basil, parsley, cilantro)

### 2–4 Weeks Before Last Frost
- **Cucumbers**
- **Squash**
- **Melons**

These grow fast indoors and transplant poorly when rootbound. Start them in larger pots (3–4 inch) and transplant before roots start circling.

### Don't Bother Starting Indoors
- **Beans** — direct sow after frost; they don't transplant well
- **Carrots** — always direct sow
- **Radishes** — fastest crop you'll grow; direct sow
- **Corn** — direct sow; needs soil warmth, not a head start
- **Peas** — direct sow 4–6 weeks before last frost; they like cold soil

## Your Setup Doesn't Need to Be Fancy

You need three things: light, warmth, and containers. That's it.

### Light

This is where most indoor seed starting fails in the Midwest. Your February windowsill does not provide enough light. Not even your south-facing one. Midwest winter light intensity is too low and day length too short for healthy seedlings.

**Get a shop light.** A basic 4-foot LED shop light hung 2–3 inches above your seedlings works better than the fanciest south-facing window in January. Run it 14–16 hours per day on a timer. Total cost: $25–40.

You don't need expensive "grow lights" unless you're scaling up. The seedlings need quantity of light, not a specific spectrum. A $30 LED shop light from the hardware store grows tomato seedlings just as well as a $150 grow light panel.

### Warmth

Seeds germinate based on soil temperature, not air temperature. Most vegetable seeds want 70–80°F soil to germinate reliably.

Your Midwest basement in February is 58–65°F. That's too cold for peppers and tomatoes, which will sit in the soil for 2–3 weeks before grudgingly sprouting (if they don't rot first).

**A seedling heat mat** ($20–30) placed under your trays raises soil temperature 10–15°F above ambient. Once seedlings are up and growing, remove the mat — they don't need extra warmth after germination.

### Containers

Anything with drainage works. Options from cheap to cheapest:

- **Cell trays (72-cell or 50-cell):** Standard choice. Reusable if you clean them between seasons.
- **Solo cups with holes punched in the bottom:** Works perfectly for tomatoes and peppers.
- **Newspaper pots you roll yourself:** Free, biodegradable, slightly fussy.
- **Egg cartons:** Too small for anything except the first 2 weeks. Transplant quickly or roots suffer.

Use a **seed-starting mix**, not garden soil and not potting soil. Seed-starting mix is sterile, fine-textured, and drains well. Garden soil introduces disease and compacts in small containers. A bag costs $5–8 and lasts most gardeners all season.

## The Mistakes That Kill Midwest Seedlings

### Overwatering

The number one killer. Seedlings in a cool Midwest basement with limited airflow are already fighting dampness. Water only when the soil surface feels dry to the touch. Bottom-watering (setting trays in a shallow dish of water for 10 minutes) gives roots moisture without keeping the surface wet.

### Starting Too Early

A tomato seedling started 12 weeks before transplant will be tall, leggy, rootbound, and stressed. It will underperform a stocky 6-week-old plant all season long. Follow the calendar above. Patience is a gardening skill.

### Skipping Hardening Off

This one kills more transplants than any pest or disease. Your seedlings have spent their entire life in still, 65°F air under artificial light. Moving them directly into full sun, 50°F nights, and Midwest wind is a death sentence.

**Hardening off schedule:** Start 7–10 days before transplant day.

- **Days 1–2:** 2 hours outside in shade, sheltered from wind
- **Days 3–4:** 4 hours with some direct morning sun
- **Days 5–6:** 6 hours, increasing sun exposure
- **Days 7–8:** Full day outside, bring in at night if below 45°F
- **Days 9–10:** Leave out overnight if no frost threat

Yes, this is tedious. Yes, it matters. Unhardened transplants get sunscald, wind damage, and transplant shock that sets them back 2–3 weeks — erasing the head start you worked for.

### Not Enough Light

If your seedlings are stretching toward the window and developing long, thin stems, they need more light. Lower your shop light to 2 inches above the tops of the seedlings and make sure it's running at least 14 hours a day. Leggy seedlings never fully recover.

## Putting It All Together: A Midwest Example

Let's say you're in central Indiana, Zone 6a, last frost around April 25.

- **February 15:** Start onions and leeks
- **February 25:** Start peppers and eggplant
- **March 10:** Start tomatoes, broccoli, cabbage
- **March 25:** Start lettuce, herbs, chard
- **April 10:** Start cucumbers, squash, melons
- **April 15–25:** Harden off cool-season transplants, plant out broccoli and cabbage (they handle light frost)
- **April 25–May 5:** Harden off and transplant warm-season crops after last frost

Adjust this calendar forward or backward based on your specific zone. Northern Minnesota gardeners shift everything 3–4 weeks later. Southern Missouri gardeners shift 2 weeks earlier.

## Your Next Step

Indoor seed starting is step one of a Midwest growing season that, done right, can run from March through November. The timing, variety selection, and season-extension techniques specific to Midwest conditions are exactly what our guide covers.
