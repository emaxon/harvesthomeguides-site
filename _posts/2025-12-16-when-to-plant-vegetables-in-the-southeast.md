You moved to the Southeast thinking the long growing season meant easy gardening. Then your [tomatoes](/blog/growing-tomatoes-in-the-south-beat-the-heat) fried in July and your [fall gardening](/blog/fall-vegetable-gardening-in-the-southeast) broccoli bolted before Thanksgiving. The Southeast's generous climate is genuinely an advantage — but only if you know *when* to put what in the ground.

This guide covers planting windows for Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Alabama, Tennessee, and Virginia. Not vague "spring" suggestions — actual dates tied to your USDA hardiness zone.

## Why Timing Matters More Here Than You Think

The Southeast spans zones 6b through 9a. That's a massive range. A gardener in the mountains of western North Carolina (zone 6b) has a completely different calendar than someone in coastal Georgia (zone 9a). A "Southeast planting guide" that doesn't acknowledge this is useless to half its readers.

Your two biggest timing enemies:

1. **Late spring frosts** that murder tender transplants (especially zones 6b–7b)
2. **Summer heat** that shuts down production on cool-season crops and stresses warm-season ones

The sweet spot? You're working with **two distinct planting seasons** — spring and fall — and the gardeners who thrive here use both.

## Know Your Last and First Frost Dates

Everything flows from these two numbers. Here's a zone-by-zone breakdown:

**Zone 6b (Western NC, mountain TN, parts of VA)**
- Last spring frost: April 15–30
- First fall frost: October 1–15
- Growing season: ~160 days

**Zone 7a (Piedmont NC, northern AL, middle TN, central VA)**
- Last spring frost: April 1–15
- First fall frost: October 15–31
- Growing season: ~190 days

**Zone 7b (Upstate SC, central AL, Nashville area)**
- Last spring frost: March 20–April 5
- First fall frost: October 25–November 5
- Growing season: ~210 days

**Zone 8a (Coastal NC, most of SC, southern AL, coastal VA)**
- Last spring frost: March 10–25
- First fall frost: November 5–20
- Growing season: ~235 days

**Zone 8b (Southern GA, coastal SC, Gulf Coast AL)**
- Last spring frost: February 25–March 10
- First fall frost: November 15–30
- Growing season: ~260 days

**Zone 9a (Extreme southern GA, coastal areas)**
- Last spring frost: February 10–25
- First fall frost: December 1–15
- Growing season: ~280+ days

## [spring planting](/blog/southeast-spring-vegetable-garden-planting-guide): Cool-Season Crops First

Start with crops that *like* cold. These go in the ground 4–8 weeks before your last frost date.

**6–8 weeks before last frost:**
- Peas (Sugar Snap, Oregon Sugar Pod)
- Lettuce (direct sow or transplant)
- Spinach (Bloomsdale Long Standing does well here)
- Radishes (Cherry Belle, French Breakfast)
- Onion sets and transplants

**4–6 weeks before last frost:**
- Broccoli transplants (Waltham 29, Green Magic)
- Cabbage transplants (Copenhagen Market)
- Cauliflower transplants (Snow Crown)
- Kale (Lacinato, Red Russian)
- Carrots (Danvers 126, Nantes)

**Pro Tip:** In zones 8a and warmer, you can start cool-season crops in January or even late December. A January-planted row of Sugar Snap peas in coastal South Carolina will produce by late March.

## Spring Planting: Warm-Season Crops

These go in *after* your last frost date — and soil temperature matters as much as air temperature. Tomatoes planted in 55°F soil will just sit there looking offended.

**At or just after last frost (soil 60°F+):**
- Tomatoes (transplants)
- Peppers (transplants)
- Squash and zucchini (direct sow)
- Cucumbers (direct sow)
- Green beans (Bush Blue Lake, Contender)

**2–4 weeks after last frost (soil 65°F+):**
- Sweet potatoes (slips) — this is a Southeast staple
- Okra (Clemson Spineless) — wants 70°F soil
- Southern peas/cowpeas (Mississippi Silver, Pinkeye Purple Hull)
- Lima beans (Henderson Bush, Jackson Wonder)
- Watermelon and cantaloupe

**What this looks like by state:**

| Crop | VA (7a) | NC Piedmont (7a) | SC Upstate (7b) | GA Coastal (8b) | AL South (8b) | TN Middle (7a) |
|------|---------|-------------------|------------------|------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Tomatoes | May 1 | Apr 25 | Apr 10 | Mar 15 | Mar 15 | Apr 20 |
| Peppers | May 5 | May 1 | Apr 15 | Mar 20 | Mar 20 | Apr 25 |
| Squash | May 1 | Apr 25 | Apr 10 | Mar 10 | Mar 10 | Apr 20 |
| Okra | May 15 | May 10 | Apr 25 | Mar 25 | Mar 25 | May 5 |
| Sweet Potatoes | May 15 | May 15 | May 1 | Apr 1 | Apr 1 | May 10 |

## The Summer Gap

Here's what catches people off guard: many crops **stop producing in mid-summer**. Temperatures above 90°F cause tomatoes to drop blossoms. Lettuce bolts. Squash vine borers show up like clockwork in June.

Zones 8a and warmer often have a **dead zone** from late June through August where the smart play is:

- Keeping [heat and humidity tolerant](/blog/best-vegetables-for-hot-humid-southern-gardens) crops going (okra, sweet potatoes, Southern peas)
- Starting fall seedlings indoors under grow lights
- Maintaining mulch and irrigation on what's still producing

Don't fight it. Work with it.

## Fall Planting: Your Second Season

This is where Southeast gardeners have a real advantage over the rest of the country. Your fall garden can be just as productive as spring — sometimes more, because pest pressure drops and cool-season crops taste better after a light frost.

**10–12 weeks before first fall frost:**
- Start broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage indoors
- Direct sow bush beans for a final harvest

**8–10 weeks before first fall frost:**
- Transplant broccoli, cabbage, collards
- Direct sow carrots, beets, turnips

**6–8 weeks before first fall frost:**
- Direct sow lettuce, spinach, kale
- Plant radishes (they're ready in 25 days)
- Garlic goes in around your first frost date

**What this means in real dates:**

For zone 7b (first frost ~November 1):
- Start fall brassica seeds indoors: mid-July
- Transplant brassicas outside: mid-August
- Direct sow greens: early September
- Plant garlic: late October to early November

For zone 8b (first frost ~November 20):
- Start fall brassica seeds indoors: early August
- Transplant brassicas outside: early September
- Direct sow greens: late September
- Plant garlic: mid-November

## Common Mistakes

**Planting warm-season crops too early.** A late March tomato in zone 7a will get hit by frost. Period. The excitement of warm February days is a trap.

**Ignoring soil temperature.** Air might be 75°F, but soil could still be 50°F. Get a soil thermometer — they're $10 and save you weeks of frustration.

**Skipping the fall garden.** If you only plant in spring, you're using about 60% of your growing season. Fall collards in North Carolina are arguably better than anything you grow in spring.

**Using generic "Zone 7" advice without accounting for local microclimates.** A south-facing slope in Tennessee warms up two weeks faster than a north-facing hollow three miles away.

## Your Next Step

Knowing *when* to plant is half the battle. The other half is knowing *what* thrives in your specific area, how to build your soil, and how to handle the pests and diseases that come with humid Southern growing.
