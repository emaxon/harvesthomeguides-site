Spring in the Southeast doesn't arrive — it lurches. One week it's 75°F and you're in shorts. The next week there's frost on your windshield. And somewhere in that chaos, you need to get a garden planted at exactly the right time.

This is your zone-by-zone spring planting calendar for the Southeast, covering zones 6b through 9a. No guessing, no "plant after danger of frost" vagueness. Actual dates, actual crops, actual sequence.

## The Spring Planting Sequence

Every spring garden follows the same basic order, just shifted by zone:

1. **Hardy cool-season crops** (tolerate frost): peas, spinach, kale, onions
2. **Semi-hardy cool-season crops** (tolerate light frost): lettuce, broccoli, cabbage, carrots
3. **Warm-season crops** (frost kills them): [tomatoes](/blog/growing-tomatoes-in-the-south-beat-the-heat), peppers, squash, beans
4. **Hot-season crops** (need warm soil): okra, sweet potatoes, melons, Southern peas

Your zone determines *when* each phase starts. Let's break it down.

## Zone 9a: Coastal South Georgia, Extreme Southeast

**Last frost: February 10–25**

You're practically subtropical. Your spring starts before most of the country finishes winter.

**January:**
- Direct sow peas, spinach, lettuce, radishes, carrots, beets
- Transplant broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, kale
- Plant onion sets and transplants
- Start tomato and pepper seeds indoors (8 weeks before transplant)

**February:**
- Continue successive plantings of lettuce, radishes
- Direct sow Swiss chard, turnips
- Mid-to-late February: transplant tomatoes, peppers (with frost protection available)
- Start sweet potato slips indoors

**March:**
- Direct sow squash, cucumbers, beans, corn
- Transplant remaining tomatoes and peppers
- Plant okra after soil hits 65°F (usually mid-March)
- Plant watermelon and cantaloupe seeds or transplants

**April:**
- Plant sweet potato slips
- Plant Southern peas
- Last chance for spring bean and squash plantings
- Cool-season crops finishing up — harvest everything before heat arrives

**Pro Tip:** Zone 9a gardeners, your cool-season window is *short*. Broccoli planted after February 1st is racing against 80°F days in April. Start early or skip it and plant heavily in [fall planting](/blog/fall-vegetable-gardening-in-the-southeast) instead.

## Zone 8b: Southern Georgia, Coastal South Carolina, Gulf Coast Alabama

**Last frost: February 25–March 10**

**February:**
- Direct sow peas (Sugar Snap, Oregon Sugar Pod), spinach, kale
- Transplant onion sets
- Start tomato and pepper seeds indoors
- Direct sow lettuce, carrots, radishes, beets

**March:**
- First two weeks: transplant broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower
- Mid-March: transplant tomatoes and peppers (after last frost)
- Direct sow beans, squash, cucumbers
- Start okra if soil is warm enough (65°F+)

**April:**
- Plant corn (Silver Queen, Peaches and Cream — need 60°F soil)
- Plant sweet potato slips (late April)
- Direct sow Southern peas, lima beans
- Plant watermelon and cantaloupe
- Succession plant squash and beans

**May:**
- Plant okra if not already in (it likes it hot)
- Final succession plantings of beans
- Mulch everything heavily — summer is coming
- Start monitoring for squash vine borers (they emerge when the soil warms)

## Zone 8a: Coastal North Carolina, Most of South Carolina, Southern Alabama

**Last frost: March 10–25**

**February:**
- Direct sow peas, spinach, kale outdoors (these are hardy)
- Start tomato, pepper, broccoli seeds indoors
- Plant onion sets and transplants

**March:**
- First half: transplant broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, kale
- Direct sow carrots (Danvers Half Long, Nantes), lettuce, beets, turnips, radishes
- Second half (after last frost): transplant tomatoes (Better Boy, Solar Fire, Cherokee Purple)
- Direct sow beans (Contender, Provider)

**April:**
- Transplant peppers
- Direct sow squash, cucumbers, corn
- Plant okra (Clemson Spineless) once soil is 65°F+
- Plant sweet potato slips (late April)
- Direct sow Southern peas

**May:**
- Plant melons if not done
- Plant sweet potato slips (early May)
- Succession plant beans and squash
- Harvest spring lettuce and spinach before they bolt

## Zone 7b: Upstate South Carolina, Central Alabama, Nashville Area, Parts of Virginia

**Last frost: March 20–April 5**

This is where timing starts getting tricky. You're warm enough for a real Southern garden but cold enough that a late frost can wreck early plantings.

**Early March:**
- Direct sow peas, spinach, kale, onion sets
- Transplant broccoli and cabbage (with row cover available for hard freezes)
- Direct sow lettuce, radishes, carrots

**Late March:**
- Continue cool-season plantings
- Start hardening off tomato and pepper transplants

**April (after last frost, typically first week):**
- Transplant tomatoes (don't rush this — soil should be 60°F minimum)
- Transplant peppers (wait until soil is 65°F)
- Direct sow beans, squash, cucumbers
- Direct sow corn (Bodacious, Incredible — 60°F soil)

**May:**
- Plant okra (early-to-mid May)
- Plant sweet potato slips (mid-May, soil must be 65°F)
- Plant Southern peas and lima beans
- Plant melons (late May for zones 7b)
- Succession plant beans every 2 weeks

**Pro Tip:** In zone 7b, keep floating row covers or frost blankets handy through mid-April. A forecast of 33°F on April 8th isn't unusual, and a single frost will kill unprotected tomato transplants.

## Zone 7a: Piedmont North Carolina, Northern Alabama, Middle Tennessee, Central Virginia

**Last frost: April 1–15**

**March:**
- Direct sow peas (early March — they handle frost)
- Transplant broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower (mid-March, with protection)
- Direct sow spinach, kale, lettuce, carrots, beets, radishes
- Plant onion sets and transplants

**April:**
- Mid-April (after last frost): transplant tomatoes and peppers
- Direct sow beans, squash, cucumbers (late April)
- Continue harvesting cool-season crops

**May:**
- Direct sow corn, okra, Southern peas
- Plant sweet potato slips (mid-May)
- Plant melon transplants (late May)
- First succession planting of beans and squash

**June:**
- Final bean and squash succession plantings (early June)
- Harvest garlic (planted previous fall)
- Mulch heavily — temperatures climbing
- Begin planning fall garden (yes, already)

## Zone 6b: Western North Carolina, Mountain Tennessee, Parts of Virginia

**Last frost: April 15–30**

You're the cool end of the Southeast. Your spring is shorter, your window is tighter, and patience is essential.

**Late March–Early April:**
- Direct sow peas, spinach, kale
- Transplant onion sets
- Start tomato and pepper seeds indoors (if not already started)

**Mid-April:**
- Transplant broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower
- Direct sow carrots, beets, lettuce, radishes
- Continue pea plantings

**Early-to-Mid May (after last frost):**
- Transplant tomatoes (use Wall-o-Water or similar season extenders if planting before May 10)
- Transplant peppers (late May — they're more cold-sensitive than tomatoes)
- Direct sow beans, squash, cucumbers

**Late May–June:**
- Plant corn, okra, Southern peas
- Plant sweet potato slips (June — needs warm soil)
- Melon transplants (early June)
- Succession plant beans

**Pro Tip:** Zone 6b mountain gardeners, your advantage is summer. While the rest of the Southeast is battling 95°F heat stress, you're growing tomatoes in 80°F bliss through August. Use it.

## Indoor Seed Starting Schedule

If you start your own transplants (and you should — it saves money and gives you better variety choices), here's the countdown:

**8–10 weeks before last frost:**
- Tomatoes
- Peppers (they're slow — start these first)
- Eggplant

**6–8 weeks before last frost:**
- Broccoli
- Cabbage
- Cauliflower
- Kale
- Collards

**4–6 weeks before last frost:**
- Cucumbers (if transplanting)
- Squash (if transplanting — direct sow is usually better)
- Melons

Harden off all transplants for 7–10 days before planting outside. Start with an hour of outdoor time in shade, gradually increasing sun exposure and time outside each day.

## Common Mistakes

**Planting tomatoes on the first warm day.** We get it. It was 78°F on March 12th and you were excited. But soil temperature matters more than air temperature, and a 40°F night the following week will set those plants back three weeks. Wait for your date.

**Skipping cool-season crops.** If you only grow tomatoes and peppers, you're missing 2–3 months of production. Peas and lettuce in February (zones 8+) give you fresh food while you're waiting for tomato weather.

**Not succession planting.** One planting of lettuce gives you two weeks of salads. Planting a new row every 10 days gives you salads from February through May. Same amount of total seed, way more food.

**Forgetting to mulch before summer.** Get 3–4 inches of mulch on everything by late May. It conserves moisture, suppresses weeds, and keeps soil temperatures more moderate. Pine straw is free in most of the Southeast.

## Put It All Together

A productive spring garden in the Southeast isn't about planting everything on one weekend in April. It's a rolling sequence that starts weeks (or months) before your last frost and continues through June. Get the timing right for your zone, and you'll be harvesting from March through November.
