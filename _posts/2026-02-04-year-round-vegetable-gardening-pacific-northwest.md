Most gardening books tell you the season starts in spring and ends in fall. In the Pacific Northwest, that advice wastes half the year. Here's how to keep your garden productive every month.

The maritime climate of western Washington, Oregon, and southwestern BC (Zones 8a–8b) gives you something few regions in North America can match: the ability to grow food outdoors in every calendar month. Not just storage crops or sprouts on a windowsill — actual vegetables, growing in actual garden beds, harvested fresh.

The key is shifting your mindset from "one season of warm-weather crops" to "four overlapping seasons of different crops." Once you internalize that, year-round production becomes not just possible but surprisingly straightforward.

## The Four Seasons of PNW Gardening

### Season 1: The Overwinter Harvest (November–February)

These are crops you planted in summer and fall that hold through winter, growing slowly or not at all but remaining harvestable.

**What you're eating:**
- Kale — planted in July, harvesting leaves all winter
- Leeks — planted in May, pulling as needed through March
- Brussels sprouts — planted in June, buttons tighten with frost
- Parsnips — planted in May, sweetening in cold soil
- Overwintering cauliflower and purple sprouting broccoli — sizing up slowly, maturing in late February–March
- Mâche, claytonia, and winter lettuce — under a cold frame or low tunnel
- Stored garlic, onions, potatoes, and winter squash from summer harvest

**What you're planting:** Almost nothing goes into the ground in this period. This is planning and seed-ordering season. If you have a cold frame, you can sow hardy lettuce and spinach in February for very early spring harvest.

**Your main job:** Harvest what's there, protect tender crops during hard freezes (below 25°F — throw row cover over everything), and plan the year ahead.

### Season 2: The Spring Surge (March–May)

This is the busiest planting period. Cool-season crops go directly into beds, and warm-season crops start indoors.

**March:**
- Direct seed peas, fava beans, radishes, arugula, and spinach outdoors
- Start tomatoes, peppers, and eggplant seeds indoors under lights
- Plant seed potatoes (St. Patrick's Day is the traditional PNW potato-planting date)
- Begin hardening off overwintered crops — they'll bolt soon and need replacement

**April:**
- Direct seed carrots, beets, chard, lettuce, and turnips
- Transplant brassica starts (broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower) outdoors
- Start cucumbers, squash, and melon seeds indoors
- Continue succession planting lettuce and radishes every 2 weeks

**May:**
- After last frost (typically May 10–15 in lowland PNW), transplant tomatoes, peppers, squash, cucumbers, and beans outdoors
- Direct seed beans and corn
- Plant basil, dill, and other tender herbs
- First pea harvest typically begins late May

**Critical timing note:** Soil temperature matters more than air temperature for warm-season transplants. Don't rush tomatoes and peppers into 50°F soil just because the frost date has passed. Wait until soil at 4-inch depth reaches 60°F, which often isn't until late May or early June. Use black plastic mulch to warm soil faster if you're impatient.

### Season 3: The Summer Peak (June–August)

The harvest is flowing, the watering is constant, and you're already planting for fall.

**June:**
- Harvest peas, lettuce, radishes, early beets, and broccoli side shoots
- Succession-plant bush beans every 2 weeks for continuous harvest
- Succession-plant lettuce in a shaded spot (it bolts in full sun by July)
- Mulch everything to conserve moisture — the dry season is starting
- Stake and prune tomatoes aggressively

**July:**
- Peak harvest: beans, cucumbers, zucchini, early tomatoes, chard, kale
- **Start fall/winter crops now:** Sow broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, kale, and cabbage in flats for transplanting in August. This is the most commonly missed step in year-round gardening. If you skip July seed-starting, you won't have winter crops.
- Harvest garlic when lower leaves brown (typically mid-July)
- Cure garlic and onions in a dry, shaded spot for 2–3 weeks

**August:**
- Transplant fall/winter brassicas into beds cleared of spring crops
- Direct seed fall carrots, beets, turnips, and rutabagas
- Direct seed overwintering spinach and lettuce (late August)
- Continue harvesting tomatoes, peppers, beans, squash
- Save seeds from open-pollinated varieties

### Season 4: The Fall Transition (September–October)

You're winding down warm-season crops and getting winter crops established before the light drops off in November.

**September:**
- Plant garlic cloves (anytime from September 15 through November)
- Plant overwintering onion sets
- Sow cover crops (crimson clover, winter rye, Austrian winter peas) on empty beds
- Harvest winter squash when stems dry and skins resist fingernail pressure
- Last tomato harvests — green tomatoes can ripen indoors on a counter
- Protect fall-planted brassicas from cabbage moths with insect netting

**October:**
- Pull spent warm-season plants and compost them (unless diseased — burn or trash diseased material)
- Spread 2–3 inches of compost on all beds
- Set up cold frames or low tunnels over winter salad beds
- Plant fava beans for overwintering (they'll germinate now and establish roots before winter)
- Harvest Brussels sprouts after the first frost

## The Year-Round Planting Calendar

Here's the condensed version. Pin this to your garden shed wall.

**January:** Order seeds. Start onion and leek seeds indoors.
**February:** Start more alliums. Sow hardy greens in cold frame. Prune fruit.
**March:** Peas, favas, potatoes outdoors. Tomatoes, peppers indoors.
**April:** Carrots, beets, brassica transplants, lettuce, chard outdoors. Squash indoors.
**May:** Everything warm goes out after last frost. Beans, corn direct seed.
**June:** Succession beans and lettuce. Harvest spring crops. Mulch.
**July:** Start fall brassicas in flats. Harvest garlic. Peak production.
**August:** Transplant winter crops. Seed fall roots and greens.
**September:** Plant garlic and overwintering onions. Cover crops on empty beds.
**October:** Compost beds. Set up season extension. Plant favas.
**November:** Harvest winter crops as needed. Planning begins.
**December:** Light harvest. Rest. Read seed catalogs.

## Infrastructure for Year-Round Success

You don't need a greenhouse to garden year-round in the PNW, but a few investments make it dramatically easier:

**Must-have:**
- **At least one raised bed** with good drainage — winter crops fail in waterlogged soil
- **A cold frame or low tunnel** over one bed for winter salads
- **Seed-starting setup indoors** — a shelf with a shop light and a heat mat gets you through March starts
- **Row cover fabric** (both lightweight for insect exclusion and heavyweight for frost protection)

**Nice-to-have:**
- **A small unheated greenhouse or hoop house** — extends the warm season by 3–4 weeks on each end and gives you a dry space for seed starting
- **Drip irrigation on a timer** — essential for the dry July–August window
- **A compost system** — you'll generate and use enormous amounts of compost gardening this intensively

## The Succession Planting Mindset

The single most important skill for year-round gardening is **succession planting** — having the next crop ready to go into a space the moment the current crop comes out.

This means:
- Starting transplants 6–8 weeks before you need them
- Having a nursery area (even a few pots on a bench) where starts grow while waiting for bed space
- Accepting that beds are never truly "resting" — they go from crop to cover crop to compost to crop, continuously

**Example bed rotation for one 4x8 raised bed over 12 months:**
1. **October–February:** Overwintering purple sprouting broccoli (transplanted August)
2. **March:** Harvest broccoli, pull plants, add compost
3. **March–June:** Direct-seed peas and lettuce
4. **June–July:** Harvest peas, pull plants, add compost
5. **July–September:** Transplant fall kale (started in June flats)
6. **September:** Interplant garlic cloves between kale plants
7. **October–March:** Harvest kale through winter, garlic grows underneath
8. **July:** Harvest garlic, start the cycle again

That's three crops plus garlic from a single 4x8 bed in one year. With four beds, you can have something to eat every single day.

## Common Mistakes in Year-Round PNW Gardening

**1. Missing the July sowing window.** If you don't start fall brassicas by mid-July, they won't size up before short days halt growth in November. This is the #1 reason people fail at winter gardening.

**2. Planting winter crops too late.** Anything going into the ground for winter needs to be established — with a good root system and several true leaves — before November 1. After that, growth slows to nearly nothing until February. You're not growing food in winter; you're *harvesting* food you grew in late summer and fall.

**3. Ignoring drainage.** Cool-season crops tolerate cold but not waterlogging. Raised beds or heavily amended in-ground beds with good drainage are essential for winter gardening.

**4. Skipping cover crops.** If a bed sits empty and bare through winter, you're losing topsoil to erosion and missing the chance to build fertility. Cover crops — even a simple scattering of crimson clover — protect and improve soil during the months between crops.

**5. Trying to grow warm-season crops year-round.** Without supplemental heat and light, tomatoes and peppers won't produce in a PNW winter. Year-round gardening means growing *different* crops in each season, not the same crops all year.

## Getting Started

If you've never gardened through a PNW winter, start this July. Sow a flat of 'Purple Sprouting' broccoli and a flat of kale. Transplant them into a bed in August. Throw row cover over them in November. Harvest from January through April.

That first winter harvest — pulling fresh broccoli from your garden while it rains sideways in February — will change how you think about the gardening year forever.

The Pacific Northwest has twelve months of growing season. Use all of them.
