You moved to New England or the Mid-Atlantic, bought some seed packets, and now you're staring at the back wondering what "after last frost" actually means when your frost dates swing by six weeks depending on whether you're in coastal Connecticut or northern Vermont.

Fair question. The Northeast is a patchwork of microclimates, and the difference between a successful garden and a frustrating one often comes down to timing — not effort.

Let's fix that.

## The Frost Dates That Actually Matter

Everything in Northeast vegetable gardening revolves around two dates: your **last spring frost** and your **first fall frost**. The gap between them is your growing season, and it varies wildly across the region.

Here's what you're working with:

- **Zone 4** (northern VT, NH, ME): Last frost May 15–June 1. First frost September 15–30. **100–130 days.**
- **Zone 5** (most of MA, CT, upstate NY, central PA): Last frost April 25–May 15. First frost October 1–15. **140–160 days.**
- **Zone 6** (southern CT, NJ, NYC metro, southeastern PA): Last frost April 10–25. First frost October 15–31. **170–190 days.**
- **Zone 7** (coastal NJ, southern tip of Long Island): Last frost March 25–April 10. First frost November 1–15. **200+ days.**

Those Zone 7 gardeners in Cape May? They're practically living in a different region than someone in Burlington, Vermont. And that's fine — you just need to plan accordingly.

**Pro Tip:** Don't trust zone maps alone. Check your county's actual frost data through your state's Cooperative Extension. Elevation, proximity to water, and urban heat islands all shift your dates.

## Cool-Season Crops: Your First Planting Window

Cool-season vegetables are [the Northeast's secret weapon](/blog/best-vegetables-for-northeast-gardens). These crops don't just tolerate cool weather — they prefer it. You can get them in the ground weeks before your last frost date.

### Direct Sow Outdoors (4–6 weeks before last frost):
- **Peas** (snap, snow, and shelling) — soil temp 40°F+
- **Spinach** — germinates in soil as cold as 35°F
- **Lettuce** — direct sow or transplant
- **Radishes** — 25–30 days to harvest, squeeze them anywhere
- **Arugula** — fast and cold-hardy down to 25°F
- **Kale** — direct sow or transplant; actually tastes better after light frost
- **Carrots** — need consistent moisture to germinate, but worth it

### Transplant Outdoors (2–4 weeks before last frost):
- **Broccoli** — start seeds indoors 6–8 weeks before transplanting
- **Cabbage** — same timeline as broccoli
- **Cauliflower** — the fussiest of the brassicas, but doable
- **Brussels sprouts** — start early; they need 80–100 days
- **Onion sets or transplants** — as soon as soil is workable

For a Zone 5 garden, that means you could be putting peas and spinach in the ground by mid-April. Zone 6? Late March. Zone 4? Early to mid-May.

## Warm-Season Crops: Patience Pays

Here's where Northeast gardeners get into trouble. You see those tomato transplants at the garden center in April, and the temptation is real. Resist.

Warm-season crops need **soil temperatures of 60°F or higher** — and that doesn't happen until well after your last frost date. A tomato planted in 50°F soil doesn't grow. It just sits there, sulking, while its roots rot.

### Transplant Outdoors (1–2 weeks AFTER last frost, soil 60°F+):
- **Tomatoes** — the crown jewel; see our [tomato growing guide](/blog/growing-tomatoes-in-the-northeast) for variety picks
- **Peppers** — even more heat-loving than tomatoes; wait until soil hits 65°F
- **Eggplant** — treat like peppers
- **Basil** — dies at the merest hint of frost

### Direct Sow Outdoors (after last frost, soil 60–70°F):
- **Beans** (bush and pole) — soil 60°F+
- **Cucumbers** — soil 65°F+
- **Summer squash and zucchini** — soil 65°F+
- **Winter squash** — soil 65°F+; needs 90–110 days, so count backward from your first frost

### The Corn, Melon, and Pumpkin Question

These crops need serious heat and long seasons:

- **Sweet corn** — soil 65°F+, needs 60–100 days depending on variety. Zone 4–5 gardeners should stick to early varieties like 'Earlivee' (58 days) or 'Sugar Buns' (72 days).
- **Watermelon** — only reliably works in Zone 6–7 without black plastic mulch and row covers. Try 'Sugar Baby' (75 days) for shorter seasons.
- **Pumpkins** — direct sow by early June in Zone 5 for October harvest.

**Pro Tip:** Use a soil thermometer. A $10 investment saves you from weeks of guessing. Take readings in the morning at 4-inch depth — that's when soil is coolest and gives you the most honest reading.

## Succession Planting: The Northeast Advantage

With 140–190 growing days in most of the region, you have time for multiple rounds of fast-maturing crops. This is how experienced Northeast gardeners fill their kitchens all season:

**Spring → Summer transition (June):**
Pull spent peas and lettuce. Replace with beans, cucumbers, or a second round of lettuce under shade cloth.

**Summer → Fall transition (July–August):**
This is the big one. By mid-July in Zone 5, start sowing:
- Kale (60 days to harvest — perfect for fall)
- Beets (55–70 days)
- Turnips (45–60 days)
- Lettuce (again — it loves fall)
- Spinach (40–50 days)
- Radishes (25 days — always radishes)

By early August, transplant broccoli and cabbage starts for a fall harvest that'll blow your spring crop out of the water. Cool fall temps + shorter days = sweeter brassicas.

**Pro Tip:** Count backward from your first frost date, add 14 days as a buffer (growth slows dramatically as days shorten), and that's your last sow date for any given crop.

## The Indoor Start Calendar

If you're starting seeds indoors under lights, here's your timeline (Zone 5 example — adjust ±2 weeks for your zone):

- **February 15–March 1:** Onions, leeks, celery (these are slow)
- **March 1–15:** Peppers, eggplant (they need warmth and time)
- **March 15–April 1:** Tomatoes (don't start earlier — leggy transplants perform worse)
- **March 15–April 1:** Broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts (for spring transplanting)
- **April 1–15:** Cucumbers, squash, melons (only 2–3 weeks before transplanting — they hate root disturbance)

The number one mistake with indoor seed starting? Starting too early. A compact, sturdy 6-week-old tomato transplant will outperform a leggy, root-bound 10-week-old plant every single time.

## Month-by-Month: What Your Garden Should Look Like

**March:** Indoor seed starting in full swing. Prune fruit trees. Order seed potatoes. Get antsy.

**April:** Cool-season crops go in the ground (Zone 5–7). Soil prep for warm-season beds. Still starting seeds indoors.

**May:** The big transition. Cool-season crops are growing. Warm-season transplants go out after last frost. Direct sow beans, squash, cucumbers by late May (Zone 5).

**June:** Everything's in. Mulch heavily. Set up drip irrigation. Start planning fall plantings.

**July:** Harvest spring crops. Sow fall crops. Side-dress tomatoes and peppers.

**August:** Fall transplants go in. Second round of greens. Enjoy peak tomato season.

**September:** Pull spent warm-season crops after first frost. Extend the season with row covers. Plant garlic.

**October:** Final harvests. Put beds to sleep. Compost everything.

## Common Mistakes

1. **Planting warm-season crops too early.** A late May frost will kill your unprotected tomatoes. Every year. Without fail.
2. **Ignoring fall planting.** July is the second most important planting month in the Northeast. Most people miss it entirely.
3. **Using national planting guides.** A guide written for Zone 8 is useless to you. Stick to region-specific resources.
4. **Not tracking your own microclimate.** Keep a garden journal. After 2–3 years, you'll know your specific frost dates better than any chart.
5. **Skipping succession planting.** One big planting = one big harvest = a week of zucchini and then nothing. Stagger your sowing dates.
