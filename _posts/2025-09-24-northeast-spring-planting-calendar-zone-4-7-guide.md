Spring in the Northeast isn't a date on the calendar — it's a negotiation. One week it's 65°F and you're in a t-shirt turning compost. The next week it's 28°F and your tulips are regretting every decision they've made.

That unpredictability is exactly why you need a planting calendar — not a vague one that says "plant after danger of frost," but a week-by-week plan tied to your actual zone.

Here it is.

## How to Use This Calendar

This calendar is organized by **weeks before and after your last frost date**. Your last frost date is the anchor for everything.

**Average last frost dates by zone:**
- **Zone 4** (northern VT, NH, ME, Adirondacks): **May 20–June 1**
- **Zone 5a** (much of VT, NH, ME coast, upstate NY, Berkshires): **May 10–20**
- **Zone 5b** (most of MA, CT interior, central PA, Catskills): **May 1–10**
- **Zone 6a** (southern CT, northern NJ, Hudson Valley, southeastern PA): **April 20–May 1**
- **Zone 6b** (NYC metro, central NJ, Philadelphia area): **April 10–20**
- **Zone 7** (coastal NJ, Long Island south shore, Cape May): **April 1–10**

Find your zone. Count backward and forward from your frost date. That's your calendar.

**Pro Tip:** These are averages. Keep an eye on your 10-day forecast and be ready to cover tender transplants if a late frost threatens. A few dollars in row cover buys a lot of insurance.

## Phase 1: Indoor Seed Starting (10–12 Weeks Before Last Frost)

This is the quiet phase. You're working under lights or on a sunny windowsill (lights are better — let's be honest) while the ground outside is frozen or soggy.

### 10–12 weeks before last frost:
- **Onions** from seed (long-day varieties: 'Ailsa Craig,' 'Walla Walla,' 'Copra')
- **Leeks** ('King Richard,' 'Bandit')
- **Celery** and **celeriac** (slow growers, need the head start)

### 8–10 weeks before last frost:
- **Peppers** — all types. They're slow. Start them now and keep them warm (75–85°F for germination). Use a heat mat.
- **Eggplant** — same timeline as peppers
- **Artichokes** (annual culture) — if you're attempting them, now's the time

### 6–8 weeks before last frost:
- **Tomatoes** — this is the sweet spot. Starting earlier leads to leggy, root-bound transplants.
- **Broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts** — for spring transplanting
- **Herbs:** basil, parsley (parsley is slow — start it now)

### 3–4 weeks before last frost:
- **Cucumbers, squash, melons** — only 2–3 weeks before transplanting. They grow fast and hate root disturbance. Use peat pots or soil blocks.

**Pro Tip:** Tomato seedlings need strong light (14–16 hours) and cool temps (60–65°F at night) to stay stocky. A warm room with weak light produces spindly, pale plants that won't perform in the garden.

## Phase 2: Early Outdoor Planting (6–4 Weeks Before Last Frost)

The soil is thawing. You can work it — maybe. Here's the test: grab a handful, squeeze it into a ball, and poke it with your finger. If it crumbles, you're good. If it stays in a dense lump, wait. Working wet soil destroys its structure.

### 6 weeks before last frost (soil 35–40°F):
- **Peas** — direct sow. All types. This is the moment.
- **Spinach** — direct sow. Germinates in cold soil.
- **Fava beans** — direct sow. Underused in the Northeast, but they love cool weather.

### 5 weeks before last frost:
- **Lettuce** — direct sow or transplant starts
- **Arugula** — direct sow
- **Radishes** — direct sow
- **Onion sets and transplants** — plant as soon as soil is workable
- **Shallots** — same as onion sets

### 4 weeks before last frost (soil 40–45°F):
- **Carrots** — direct sow. Keep moist until germination.
- **Beets** — direct sow or transplant (beet "seeds" are actually clusters — thin to 3–4 inches)
- **Turnips** — direct sow
- **Swiss chard** — direct sow or transplant
- **Parsnips** — direct sow. Fresh seed only; parsnip seed viability drops dramatically after one year.
- **Kale** — direct sow or transplant
- **Kohlrabi** — transplant

### 3 weeks before last frost (soil 45–50°F):
- **Potatoes** — plant seed potatoes 4 inches deep
- **Broccoli transplants** — harden off and plant out
- **Cabbage transplants** — same
- **Cauliflower transplants** — same, but protect from hard freeze (<25°F)

**Pro Tip:** Hardening off matters. Move transplants outside for increasing periods over 7–10 days before planting. Skip this step and your coddled indoor starts will sunburn, wind-stress, and stall for two weeks. It's the difference between a plant that takes off and one that sulks.

## Phase 3: Last Frost Week (The Transition)

This is the anxious week. You're watching forecasts obsessively. Your warm-season transplants are hardened off and begging to get in the ground.

### Last frost week:
- **Continue planting all cool-season crops** (second succession of peas, lettuce, radishes)
- **Prepare warm-season beds** — lay black plastic mulch if using, set up cages/stakes

### What NOT to plant yet:
- Tomatoes, peppers, eggplant, basil, cucumbers, squash, beans, corn
- These need warm soil. Your last frost date is the earliest possible, not the target date. Wait.

## Phase 4: After Last Frost (Weeks 1–4)

Now the warm-season garden comes alive.

### 1 week after last frost (soil 55–60°F):
- **Tomatoes** — transplant. Bury the stem up to the first set of true leaves. (Zone 4 gardeners: consider Wall O' Waters set out 2 weeks before last frost for a head start.)
- **Basil** — transplant. Dies instantly in frost. No exceptions.

### 1–2 weeks after last frost (soil 60°F+):
- **Beans** — direct sow bush beans. First of 3–4 succession plantings.
- **Cucumbers** — transplant or direct sow
- **Summer squash, zucchini** — direct sow or transplant
- **Dill** — direct sow

### 2–3 weeks after last frost (soil 65°F+):
- **Peppers** — transplant. They want warmer soil than tomatoes.
- **Eggplant** — transplant.
- **Winter squash, pumpkins** — direct sow or transplant
- **Sweet corn** — direct sow in blocks (not rows) for pollination. Minimum 4x4 block.
- **Melons** — transplant into black plastic with row cover. Zone 5+ only for most varieties.

### 3–4 weeks after last frost (soil 70°F):
- **Sweet potatoes** — slips into well-warmed soil. Zone 6–7 only for reliable results.
- **Pole beans** — direct sow at base of trellises
- **Okra** — Zone 7 only without season extension

**Pro Tip:** Soil temperature is more important than air temperature for warm-season crops. Use a soil thermometer. Take readings at 4-inch depth in the morning. That $10 tool eliminates guesswork.

## Zone-by-Zone Cheat Sheet

Here's what a typical spring looks like in each zone:

### Zone 4 (Last frost: ~May 25)

- **May 1:** Carrots, beets, lettuce, potatoes outdoors
- **May 15:** Brassica transplants outdoors
- **June 1:** Tomatoes outdoors. Beans, cucumbers, squash.
- **June 10:** Peppers, eggplant, corn, melons (pushing it)

### Zone 5 (Last frost: ~May 10)
- **March 1:** Start peppers indoors
- **March 15:** Start tomatoes, brassicas indoors

## Common Mistakes

1. **Planting by the calendar instead of conditions.** A warm March followed by an April cold snap will kill unprotected transplants. Use dates as guidelines, weather as the final authority.
2. **Starting seeds too early indoors.** Six weeks for tomatoes. Not eight. Not ten. Six.
3. **Forgetting to harden off.** The #1 cause of transplant failure in the Northeast.
4. **Not staggering plantings.** One row of lettuce planted all at once = two weeks of salad followed by nothing. Plant a short row every 10–14 days.
5. **Ignoring soil temperature.** Just because the air is warm doesn't mean the soil has caught up. Cold, wet soil rots seeds and stalls transplants.

## Your Spring Starts Here

Print this calendar. Tape it to your fridge. Adjust the dates for your specific zone. And then actually follow it — the single biggest improvement most Northeast gardeners can make is simply timing things right.
