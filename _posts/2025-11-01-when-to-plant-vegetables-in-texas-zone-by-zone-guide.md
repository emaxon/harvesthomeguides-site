Texas spans four USDA hardiness zones and over 800 miles north to south. A planting date that works in Amarillo will get your seedlings killed in San Antonio — and vice versa. If you've ever Googled "when to plant tomatoes in Texas" and gotten five different answers, this is why.

Your zip code matters more than any generic planting chart. So let's break Texas down zone by zone and give you real dates you can actually use.

## Understanding Texas USDA Zones

Before we dig in, here's the quick map:

- **Zone 7a (0°F to 5°F):** Amarillo, Lubbock, parts of the Panhandle
- **Zone 7b (5°F to 10°F):** Wichita Falls, Abilene, Midland
- **Zone 8a (10°F to 15°F):** Dallas-Fort Worth, Tyler, Texarkana
- **Zone 8b (15°F to 20°F):** Austin, San Antonio, Waco
- **Zone 9a (20°F to 25°F):** Houston, Beaumont, Victoria
- **Zone 9b (25°F to 30°F):** Corpus Christi, Laredo
- **Zone 10a (30°F to 35°F):** Brownsville, McAllen, the Rio Grande Valley

These zones tell you your average annual minimum temperature — basically, how cold your worst winter night gets. That number dictates what survives outdoors and when you can safely plant.

## Zone 7a–7b: The Panhandle and North Texas

**Last spring frost:** Mid-April (April 10–20)
**First fall frost:** Late October (October 20–November 1)

You have roughly a 180-day growing season. That sounds generous until you factor in the wind, the hail, and the fact that May can still throw a 35°F morning at you.

**Spring planting windows:**
- **Cool-season crops (lettuce, spinach, peas, radishes):** Direct sow mid-February to mid-March. These can handle light frost.
- **Warm-season crops (tomatoes, peppers, squash, beans):** Transplant after April 15. Direct-sow beans and squash after April 20.
- **Hot-season crops (okra, black-eyed peas, melons):** Wait until May 1 when soil temperatures are consistently above 65°F.

**Fall planting windows:**
- Start cool-season crops again in mid-August through September. You'll get a solid harvest before hard freeze hits.
- Garlic goes in the ground mid-October.

**Pro Tip:** In the Panhandle, wind protection matters as much as temperature. A simple row cover or windbreak can extend your season by two to three weeks on both ends.

## Zone 8a: Dallas-Fort Worth and East Texas

**Last spring frost:** March 15–25
**First fall frost:** November 10–20

This is where most Texas gardening advice is calibrated — and where it starts to feel like the state has two distinct growing seasons.

**Spring planting windows:**
- **Cool-season crops:** January 15 through February for transplants. Direct sow lettuce and spinach as early as February 1.
- **Warm-season crops:** Transplant tomatoes and peppers March 20–April 5. Direct-sow squash, cucumbers, and beans after March 25.
- **Hot crops:** Okra and melons go in mid-April when soil hits 70°F.

**Fall planting windows:**
- **Cool-season round two:** Start transplants of broccoli, cauliflower, and cabbage in late August. Direct sow lettuce and spinach in September.
- **Garlic:** Plant cloves in late October to early November.

**Pro Tip:** In the DFW area, that alkaline clay soil (pH 7.5–8.5) is your biggest challenge. Amend with 3–4 inches of compost per season. Raised beds with imported garden soil are the shortcut most successful gardeners take.

## Zone 8b: Austin, San Antonio, and Central Texas

**Last spring frost:** March 1–15
**First fall frost:** November 20–December 1

Central Texas gardeners get an enviable growing season — roughly 260 days. The challenge isn't length, it's the brutal June-through-September heat that shuts down tomato production and makes cool-season crops bolt overnight.

**Spring planting windows:**
- **Cool-season crops:** Start in mid-January. You have until early March before warming temperatures push lettuce to bolt.
- **Warm-season crops:** Transplant tomatoes February 25–March 10. Yes, that early. You want fruit set before nighttime temps consistently exceed 75°F.
- **Squash and beans:** Direct sow March 1–15.

**Fall planting windows:**
- **Warm-season round two:** Plant a second round of tomatoes (transplants) in mid-July for fall harvest. Use heat-tolerant varieties like 'Solar Fire' or 'HeatMaster.'
- **Cool-season crops:** Start broccoli and cauliflower transplants in September. Direct sow lettuce, kale, and spinach in October.

**Pro Tip:** In Austin and San Antonio, the caliche layer — limestone rock sitting 6 to 18 inches below the surface — limits root depth. Raised beds aren't optional here. They're infrastructure.

## Zone 9a–9b: Houston, the Gulf Coast, and South Texas

**Last spring frost:** February 10–25
**First fall frost:** December 5–20

Now we're talking. Zone 9 gardeners have a 280+ day season and can grow things that make Panhandle gardeners jealous — citrus, long-season peppers, sweet potatoes that actually reach full size.

**Spring planting windows:**
- **Cool-season crops:** November through February. You read that right. Houston-area gardeners grow lettuce and broccoli through the winter.
- **Warm-season crops:** Transplant tomatoes and peppers in mid-February. Direct sow everything else by early March.
- **Tropical and sub-tropical:** Plant sweet potato slips and okra in April.

**Fall planting windows:**
- **Second tomato season:** Transplant heat-tolerant varieties in August for October-November harvest.
- **Winter garden:** Plant cool-season crops in October and harvest through February.

The Houston challenge isn't cold — it's humidity. Fungal diseases (early blight, powdery mildew, downy mildew) are your primary enemy. Space plants widely for airflow and use drip irrigation instead of overhead watering.

## Zone 10a: The Rio Grande Valley

**Last spring frost:** Rare — maybe once every few years
**First fall frost:** Late December if at all

The Valley is practically subtropical. Your growing season is year-round, and your planting calendar looks nothing like the rest of Texas.

**Year-round planting:**
- **Tomatoes:** Plant October through February for best results. Summer heat (100°F+) prevents fruit set.
- **Peppers:** Nearly year-round, but best planted September through March.
- **Cool-season crops:** October through March.
- **Warm-season crops:** February through May, then again September through November.

**The summer gap:** June through August is your rest period in the Valley. Temperatures above 100°F, combined with humidity, make most vegetable production impractical. Use this time to solarize soil, add compost, and plan your fall garden.

**Pro Tip:** Valley gardeners should think of winter as their prime growing season. It's counterintuitive if you moved from up north, but your best tomatoes will come from January and February harvests.

## General Rules Across All Texas Zones

1. **Soil temperature matters more than air temperature.** Use a soil thermometer. Tomatoes need 60°F soil minimum. Peppers need 65°F. Okra needs 70°F.

2. **Mulch everything.** Three to four inches of hardwood mulch reduces soil temperature by 10–15°F in summer and conserves moisture. In Texas heat, this isn't decorative — it's survival.

3. **Water deeply, water less often.** One inch per week, applied in one or two deep sessions, beats daily light sprinkling every time. Deep watering encourages deep roots, and deep roots survive Texas summers.

4. **Plan for two seasons.** Every zone in Texas supports a spring and a fall garden. The fall garden is often more productive because pest pressure drops and temperatures moderate. Don't pack up after the summer harvest.

5. **Track your own microclimate.** South-facing walls, proximity to concrete, tree cover, elevation changes — these create microclimates that can shift your effective zone by half a zone or more. A thermometer in your actual garden beats any zone map.

## Your Next Step

Knowing when to plant is the foundation — but Texas gardening throws curveballs that generic advice can't prepare you for. If you want the complete picture — soil prep for every region, variety recommendations tested in Texas conditions, month-by-month planting calendars, and pest management that actually works here — pick up the *Harvest Home Guides: Texas Vegetable Gardening* book. It's the guide we wish we'd had when we started growing in this beautiful, frustrating state.
