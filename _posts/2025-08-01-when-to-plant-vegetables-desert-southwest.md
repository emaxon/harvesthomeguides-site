If you're planting tomatoes in April and wondering why they're dying by June, you've got the timing backwards. The desert Southwest plays by its own rules — and once you understand them, you'll grow more food than you thought possible in a place where the ground temperature hits 160°F in July.

This guide covers planting timing for USDA Zones 8a through 10b across Arizona, New Mexico, and Nevada. Whether you're in the low desert of Phoenix (Zone 9b-10a), the middle elevations of Albuquerque (Zone 7b), or the high desert of Las Vegas (Zone 9a), your success comes down to one thing: **planting at the right time**.

## The Two-Season Reality

Forget everything you learned from gardening books written for the Midwest. In the desert Southwest, you don't have one growing season — you have **two main windows and a brutal gap** in between.

**Spring Season (February–May):** Your cool-season crops go in as early as January in the low desert. Warm-season crops follow in February and March — yes, February. By the time gardeners in Ohio are starting seeds indoors, your tomatoes should already be setting fruit.

**Fall Season (August–November):** This is your second chance, and honestly, it's the better one. Lower sun angle, cooling temperatures, and — if you're lucky — [monsoon moisture](/blog/southwest-monsoon-season-planting-guide). Many desert gardeners produce more food in fall than spring.

**The Dead Zone (June–mid-August):** When daytime highs exceed 110°F and nighttime lows stay above 85°F, most vegetables simply stop producing. Tomatoes drop their blossoms. Peppers stall. Lettuce bolts so fast it looks like it's trying to escape. This isn't failure — it's physics.

## Low Desert Planting Calendar (Zones 9b-10a)

This covers Phoenix, Tucson, Yuma, and the lower elevations of southern Arizona and Nevada.

### Cool-Season Crops

| Crop | Plant Seeds/Transplants | Harvest Window |
|------|------------------------|----------------|
| Lettuce | Sep 15 – Feb 15 | Nov – Apr |
| Broccoli | Sep 1 – Oct 15 | Nov – Feb |
| Carrots | Sep 15 – Feb 1 | Dec – Apr |
| Peas | Oct 1 – Jan 15 | Dec – Mar |
| Spinach | Oct 1 – Feb 1 | Nov – Mar |
| Beets | Sep 15 – Feb 15 | Nov – Apr |
| Cauliflower | Sep 1 – Oct 1 | Dec – Feb |
| Kale | Sep 15 – Feb 1 | Nov – Apr |

### Warm-Season Crops

| Crop | Plant Seeds/Transplants | Harvest Window |
|------|------------------------|----------------|
| Tomatoes | Jan 15 – Mar 1 (transplants) | Apr – Jun |
| Peppers | Feb 1 – Mar 15 | May – Jun, Sep – Nov |
| Squash | Feb 15 – Mar 15, Aug 1 – Aug 15 | Apr – Jun, Oct – Nov |
| Cucumbers | Feb 15 – Mar 15, Aug 1 – Sep 1 | Apr – Jun, Oct – Nov |
| Melons | Mar 1 – Apr 1 | Jun – Jul |
| Beans | Feb 15 – Mar 15, Aug 15 – Sep 15 | Apr – May, Oct – Nov |
| Corn | Feb 1 – Mar 15 | May – Jun |
| Armenian Cucumber | Mar 1 – Apr 1, Aug 1 | May – Jun, Oct |

**Pro Tip:** In Phoenix, your tomato transplants should go into the ground by Valentine's Day. Not April. Not "when it warms up." By the time most people think it's tomato season, yours should already have fruit on the vine.

## Middle Elevation Calendar (Zones 8a-8b)

This covers Albuquerque, Santa Fe (lower areas), Las Cruces, Prescott, and Flagstaff-adjacent valleys.

At 4,000–6,000 feet, you get actual freezing winters and genuinely hot summers — but not the sustained 110°F+ that cooks the low desert. Your window looks more traditional, but shifted earlier than you'd expect.

**Last frost:** Mid-March to mid-April depending on your specific elevation
**First frost:** Mid-October to early November

**Spring planting:** Start cool-season crops 4–6 weeks before last frost (as early as February under row cover). Warm-season transplants go out 2–3 weeks after last frost when soil temperature hits 65°F at 4-inch depth.

**Fall planting:** Start fall cool-season crops by mid-August. You're racing the first frost, but the cooling temperatures are on your side.

### Varieties That Perform at Elevation

Not all varieties handle the intense UV and wide day/night temperature swings at elevation. These consistently produce:

- **Tomatoes:** 'Early Girl,' 'Stupice,' 'New Mexico Heritage Big Jim' (yes, it's a real tomato, not just the chile)
- **Chile peppers:** 'NuMex Joe E. Parker,' 'Sandia,' 'Chimayo' — bred for exactly these conditions
- **Squash:** 'Costata Romanesco,' 'Tatume' (a Southwestern native that laughs at squash vine borers)
- **Beans:** 'Bolita,' 'Anasazi' — heritage varieties adapted to desert soils and low water

## High Desert Special Considerations (Las Vegas, Zone 9a)

Las Vegas sits in a unique spot — Zone 9a with very low humidity, alkaline soil (pH 7.5–8.5), and fierce wind. Your calendar tracks close to the low desert, but wind protection matters as much as sun protection.

**Critical adjustment:** Wind desiccation kills more transplants here than heat does in spring. Use windbreaks — even temporary ones made from shade cloth — for the first 3 weeks after transplanting.

Plant tomato transplants by **late February to mid-March**. Your fall window opens **August 1** for warm-season succession and **September 1** for cool-season crops.

## Soil Temperature: The Real Calendar

Paper dates are guidelines. **Soil temperature is your actual calendar.** Buy a soil thermometer — they cost $8 and save you hundreds in failed plantings.

| Crop Type | Minimum Soil Temp (4" depth) |
|-----------|------------------------------|
| Lettuce, spinach, peas | 40°F |
| Carrots, beets, radishes | 45°F |
| Beans, corn, squash | 60°F |
| Tomatoes, peppers, melons | 65°F |
| Eggplant, okra, sweet potato | 70°F |

In the low desert, soil temperatures can hit 65°F by **late January** — which is why February tomato planting works. In Albuquerque, you might wait until **mid-April** for the same soil temperature.

## The Monsoon Pivot

If you're reading this in July, drenched in sweat and staring at your dead garden, here's the good news: monsoon season (roughly July–September) is your signal to start fall planting. The increased humidity and afternoon cloud cover drop temperatures just enough to get seeds germinated and transplants established.

**August 1 in the low desert** is your green light for:
- Bush beans (direct seed)
- Summer squash and zucchini (direct seed)
- Cucumber transplants (start seeds indoors in mid-July)
- Pepper transplants (if you kept them alive through the dead zone)

**Pro Tip:** Don't water right before an expected monsoon storm. The combination of saturated soil and sudden heavy rain causes root rot faster than you can say "Sonoran Desert."

## Common Mistakes

1. **Planting warm-season crops too late.** By the time April "feels right," you've already lost 6–8 weeks of prime growing time in the low desert.

2. **Ignoring the fall season entirely.** Fall is arguably the best growing season in the Southwest. Don't pack it in after the summer die-off.

3. **Using national planting guides.** That seed packet saying "plant after last frost" was written for Zone 6. You need desert-specific timing.

4. **Skipping soil temperature checks.** Air temperature means nothing to a seed buried 2 inches underground. Measure what matters.

5. **Fighting the dead zone.** Unless you have serious shade infrastructure, don't waste water trying to keep summer crops alive through July. Let them go and plan for fall.

## Your Next Step

Knowing *when* to plant is half the battle. The other half — soil preparation, watering strategies, variety selection, and pest management specific to the desert — is exactly what our **Harvest Home Guide for the Southwest** covers in detail. It's the planting guide that was actually written for your climate, not adapted from a book about Iowa.
